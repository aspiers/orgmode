@node Summary, Installation, Introduction, Introduction
@section Summary
@cindex summary

Org-mode is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing
project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.

Org-mode develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that contain
lists or information about projects as plain text.  Org-mode is
implemented on top of outline-mode, which makes it possible to keep the
content of large files well structured.  Visibility cycling and
structure editing help to work with the tree.  Tables are easily created
with a built-in table editor.  Org-mode supports TODO items, deadlines,
time stamps, and scheduling.  It dynamically compiles entries into an
agenda that utilizes and smoothly integrates much of the Emacs calendar
and diary.  Plain text URL-like links connect to websites, emails,
Usenet messages, BBDB entries, and any files related to the projects.
For printing and sharing of notes, an Org-mode file can be exported as a
structured ASCII file, as HTML, or (todo and agenda items only) as an
iCalendar file.  It can also serve as a publishing tool for a set of
linked webpages.

An important design aspect that distinguishes Org-mode from for example
Planner/Muse is that it encourages to store every piece of information
only once.  In Planner, you have project pages, day pages and possibly
other files, duplicating some information such as tasks.  In Org-mode,
you only have notes files.  In your notes you mark entries as tasks,
label them with tags and timestamps.  All necessary lists like a
schedule for the day, the agenda for a meeting, tasks lists selected by
tags etc are created dynamically when you need them.

Org-mode keeps simple things simple.  When first fired up, it should
feel like a straightforward, easy to use outliner.  Complexity is not
imposed, but a large amount of functionality is available when you need
it.  Org-mode is a toolbox and can be used in different ways, for
example as:

@example
@r{@bullet{} outline extension with visibility cycling and structure editing}
@r{@bullet{} ASCII system and table editor for taking structured notes}
@r{@bullet{} ASCII table editor with spreadsheet-like capabilities}
@r{@bullet{} TODO list editor}
@r{@bullet{} full agenda and planner with deadlines and work scheduling}
@r{@bullet{} environment to implement David Allen's GTD system}
@r{@bullet{} a basic database application}
@r{@bullet{} simple hypertext system, with HTML and LaTeX export}
@r{@bullet{} publishing tool to create a set of interlinked webpages}
@end example

Org-mode's automatic, context sensitive table editor with spreadsheet
capabilities can be integrated into any major mode by activating the
minor Orgtbl-mode.  Using a translation step, it can be used to maintain
tables in arbitrary file types, for example in La@TeX{}.  The structure
editing and list creation capabilities can be used outside Org-mode with
the minor Orgstruct-mode.

@cindex FAQ
There is a website for Org-mode which provides links to the newest
version of Org-mode, as well as additional information, frequently asked
questions (FAQ), links to tutorials etc.  This page is located at

@node Installation, Activation, Summary, Introduction
@section Installation
@cindex installation
@cindex XEmacs

@b{Important:} @i{If Org-mode is part of the Emacs distribution or an
XEmacs package, please skip this section and go directly to
@ref{Activation}.}

If you have downloaded Org-mode from the Web, you must take the
following steps to install it: Go into the Org-mode distribution
directory and edit the top section of the file @file{Makefile}.  You
must set the name of the Emacs binary (likely either @file{emacs} or
@file{xemacs}), and the paths to the directories where local Lisp and
Info files are kept.  If you don't have access to the system-wide
directories, create your own two directories for these files, enter them
into the Makefile, and make sure Emacs finds the Lisp files by adding
the following line to @file{.emacs}:

@example
(setq load-path (cons "~/path/to/lispdir" load-path))
@end example

@b{XEmacs users now need to install the file @file{noutline.el} from
the @file{xemacs} subdirectory of the Org-mode distribution.  Use the
command:}

@example
@b{make install-noutline}
@end example

@noindent Now byte-compile and install the Lisp files with the shell
commands:

@example
make
make install
@end example

@noindent If you want to install the info documentation, use this command:

@example
make install-info
@end example

@noindent Then add to @file{.emacs}:

@lisp
;; This line only if org-mode is not part of the X/Emacs distribution.
(require 'org-install)
@end lisp

@iftex
@b{Important:} @i{If you use copy-and-paste to copy lisp code from the
PDF documentation as viewed by Acrobat reader to your .emacs file, the
single quote character comes out incorrectly and the code will not work.
You need to fix the single quotes by hand, or copy from Info
documentation.}
@end iftex

Add the following lines to your @file{.emacs} file.  The last two lines
define @emph{global} keys for the commands @command{org-store-link} and
@command{org-agenda} - please choose suitable keys yourself.

@lisp
;; The following lines are always needed.  Choose your own keys.
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.org\\'" . org-mode))
(global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
(global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
@end lisp

Furthermore, you must activate @code{font-lock-mode} in org-mode
buffers, because significant functionality depends on font-locking being
active.  You can do this with either one of the following two lines
(XEmacs user must use the second option):
@lisp
(global-font-lock-mode 1)                     ; for all buffers
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)  ; org-mode buffers only
@end lisp

@cindex org-mode, turning on
With this setup, all files with extension @samp{.org} will be put
into Org-mode.  As an alternative, make the first line of a file look
like this:

@example
MY PROJECTS    -*- mode: org; -*-
@end example

@noindent which will select Org-mode for this buffer no matter what
the file's name is.  See also the variable
@code{org-insert-mode-line-in-empty-file}.

@cindex maintainer
@cindex author

If you find problems with Org-mode, or if you have questions, remarks,
or ideas about it, please contact the maintainer @value{MAINTAINER} at
@value{MAINTAINEREMAIL}.

For bug reports, please provide as much information as possible,
including the version information of Emacs (@kbd{C-h v emacs-version
@key{RET}}) and Org-mode (@kbd{C-h v org-version @key{RET}}), as well as
the Org-mode related setup in @file{.emacs}.  If an error occurs, a
backtrace can be very useful (see below on how to create one).  Often a
small example file helps, along with clear information about:

@enumerate
@item What exactly did you do?
@item What did you expect to happen?
@item What happened instead?
@end enumerate
@noindent Thank you for helping to improve this mode.

@subsubheading How to create a useful backtrace

@cindex backtrace of an error
If working with Org-mode produces an error with a message you don't
understand, you may have hit a bug.  The best way to report this is by
providing, in addition to what was mentioned above, a @emph{Backtrace}.
This is information from the built-in debugger about where and how the
error occurred.  Here is how to produce a useful backtrace:

@enumerate
@item
Start a fresh Emacs or XEmacs, and make sure that it will load the
original Lisp code in @file{org.el} instead of the compiled version in
@file{org.elc}.  The backtrace contains much more information if it is
produced with uncompiled code.  To do this, either rename @file{org.elc}
to something else before starting Emacs, or ask Emacs explicitly to load
@file{org.el} by using the command line
@example
emacs -l /path/to/org.el
@end example
@item
Go to the @code{Options} menu and select @code{Enter Debugger on Error}
(XEmacs has this option in the @code{Troubleshooting} sub-menu).
@item
Do whatever you have to do to hit the error.  Don't forget to
document the steps you take.
@item
When you hit the error, a @file{*Backtrace*} buffer will appear on the
screen.  Save this buffer to a file (for example using @kbd{C-x C-w}) and
attach it to your bug report.
@end enumerate

@node Conventions,  , Feedback, Introduction
@section Typesetting conventions used in this manual

Org-mode uses three types of keywords: TODO keywords, tags, and property
names.  In this manual we use the following conventions:

@table @code
@item TODO
@itemx WAITING
TODO keywords are written with all capitals, even if they are
user-defined.
@item boss
@itemx ARCHIVE
User-defined tags are written in lowercase; built-in tags with special
meaning are written with all capitals.
@item Release
@itemx PRIORITY
User-defined properties are capitalized; built-in properties with
special meaning are written with all capitals.

of this structure is achieved by folding (hiding) large parts of the
document to show only the general document structure and the parts
currently being worked on.  Org-mode greatly simplifies the use of
outlines by compressing the entire show/hide functionality into a single
command @command{org-cycle}, which is bound to the @key{TAB} key.

@node Headlines, Visibility cycling, Outlines, Document structure
@section Headlines
@cindex headlines
@cindex outline tree

Headlines define the structure of an outline tree.  The headlines in
Org-mode start with one or more stars, on the left margin@footnote{See
the variable @code{org-special-ctrl-a/e} to configure special behavior
of @kbd{C-a} and @kbd{C-e} in headlines.}.  For example:

@example
* Top level headline
** Second level
*** 3rd level
    some text
*** 3rd level
    more text

* Another top level headline
@end example

@noindent Some people find the many stars too noisy and would prefer an
outline that has whitespace followed by a single star as headline
starters.  @ref{Clean view} describes a setup to realize this.

An empty line after the end of a subtree is considered part of it and
will be hidden when the subtree is folded.  However, if you leave at
least two empty lines, one empty line will remain visible after folding
the subtree, in order to structure the collapsed view.  See the
variable @code{org-cycle-separator-lines} to modify this behavior.

@section Visibility cycling
@cindex cycling, visibility

@cindex show hidden text
@cindex hide text

Outlines make it possible to hide parts of the text in the buffer.
Org-mode uses just two commands, bound to @key{TAB} and
@kbd{S-@key{TAB}} to change the visibility in the buffer.

@cindex subtree visibility states
@cindex subtree cycling
@cindex folded, subtree visibility state
@cindex children, subtree visibility state

@kindex @key{TAB}
@item @key{TAB}
@emph{Subtree cycling}: Rotate current subtree among the states

@example
,-> FOLDED -> CHILDREN -> SUBTREE --.
'-----------------------------------'
@end example

The cursor must be on a headline for this to work@footnote{see, however,
the option @code{org-cycle-emulate-tab}.}.  When the cursor is at the
beginning of the buffer and the first line is not a headline, then
@key{TAB} actually runs global cycling (see below)@footnote{see the
option @code{org-cycle-global-at-bob}.}.  Also when called with a prefix
argument (@kbd{C-u @key{TAB}}), global cycling is invoked.

@cindex global visibility states
@cindex global cycling
@cindex overview, global visibility state
@cindex contents, global visibility state
@cindex show all, global visibility state
@kindex S-@key{TAB}
@item S-@key{TAB}
@itemx C-u @key{TAB}
@emph{Global cycling}: Rotate the entire buffer among the states

@example
,-> OVERVIEW -> CONTENTS -> SHOW ALL --.
'--------------------------------------'
@end example

When @kbd{S-@key{TAB}} is called with a numerical prefix N, the CONTENTS
view up to headlines of level N will be shown.
Note that inside tables, @kbd{S-@key{TAB}} jumps to the previous field.

@cindex show all, command
@kindex C-c C-a
@item C-c C-a
Show all.
@kindex C-c C-r
@item C-c C-r
Reveal context around point, showing the current entry, the following
heading and the hierarchy above.  Useful for working near a location
that has been exposed by a sparse tree command (@pxref{Sparse trees}) or
an agenda command (@pxref{Agenda commands}).  With prefix arg show, on
each

level, all sibling headings.
@kindex C-c C-x b
@item C-c C-x b
Show the current subtree in an indirect buffer@footnote{The indirect
buffer
@ifinfo
(@pxref{Indirect Buffers,,,emacs,GNU Emacs Manual})
@end ifinfo
@ifnotinfo
(see the Emacs manual for more information about indirect buffers)
@end ifnotinfo
will contain the entire buffer, but will be narrowed to the current
tree.  Editing the indirect buffer will also change the original buffer,
but without affecting visibility in that buffer.}.  With numerical
prefix ARG, go up to this level and then take that tree.  If ARG is
negative, go up that many levels.  With @kbd{C-u} prefix, do not remove
the previously used indirect buffer.
@end table

When Emacs first visits an Org-mode file, the global state is set to
OVERVIEW, i.e. only the top level headlines are visible.  This can be
configured through the variable @code{org-startup-folded}, or on a
per-file basis by adding one of the following lines anywhere in the
buffer:

@example
#+STARTUP: overview
#+STARTUP: content
#+STARTUP: showall
@end example

@node Motion, Structure editing, Visibility cycling, Document structure
@section Motion
@cindex motion, between headlines
@cindex jumping, to headlines
@cindex headline navigation
The following commands jump to other headlines in the buffer.

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c C-n
@item C-c C-n
Next heading.
@kindex C-c C-p
@item C-c C-p
Previous heading.
@kindex C-c C-f

@kindex C-c C-u
@item C-c C-u
Backward to higher level heading.
@kindex C-c C-j
@item C-c C-j
Jump to a different place without changing the current outline
visibility.  Shows the document structure in a temporary buffer, where
you can use the following keys to find your destination:
@example
@key{TAB}         @r{Cycle visibility.}
@key{down} / @key{up}   @r{Next/previous visible headline.}
n / p        @r{Next/previous visible headline.}

creation of a new headline, use a prefix arg, or first press @key{RET}
to get to the beginning of the next line.  When this command is used in
the middle of a line, the line is split and the rest of the line becomes
the new headline.  If the command is used at the beginning of a
headline, the new headline is created before the current line.  If at
the beginning of any other line, the content of that line is made the
new heading.  If the command is used at the end of a folded subtree
(i.e. behind the ellipses at the end of a headline), then a headline
like the current one will be inserted after the end of the subtree.
@kindex C-@key{RET}
@item C-@key{RET}
Insert a new heading after the current subtree, same level as the
current headline.  This command works from anywhere in the entry.

@item C-c C-x M-w
Copy subtree to kill ring.  With prefix arg, copy N sequential subtrees.
@kindex C-c C-x C-y
@item C-c C-x C-y
Yank subtree from kill ring.  This does modify the level of the subtree to
make sure the tree fits in nicely at the yank position.  The yank
level can also be specified with a prefix arg, or by yanking after a
headline marker like @samp{****}.
@kindex C-c C-w
@item C-c C-w
Refile entry to a different location.  @xref{Refiling notes}.
@kindex C-c ^
@item C-c ^
Sort same-level entries.  When there is an active region, all entries in
the region will be sorted.  Otherwise the children of the current
headline are sorted.  The command prompts for the sorting method, which
can be alphabetically, numerically, by time (using the first time stamp
in each entry), by priority, and each of these in reverse order.  You
can also supply your own function to extract the sorting key.  With a
@kbd{C-u} prefix, sorting will be case-sensitive.  With two @kbd{C-u
C-u} prefixes, duplicate entries will also be removed.
@end table

@cindex region, active

When there is an active region (transient-mark-mode), promotion and
demotion work on all headlines in the region.  To select a region of
headlines, it is best to place both point and mark at the beginning of a
line, mark at the beginning of the first headline, and point at the line
just after the last headline to change.  Note that when the cursor is
inside a table (@pxref{Tables}), the Meta-Cursor keys have different
functionality.

@cindex archiving

When a project represented by a (sub)tree is finished, you may want
to move the tree out of the way and to stop it from contributing to the
agenda.  Org-mode knows two ways of archiving.  You can mark a tree with
the ARCHIVE tag, or you can move an entire (sub)tree to a different
location.

@menu
* ARCHIVE tag::                 Marking a tree as inactive
* Moving subtrees::             Moving a tree to an archive file
@end menu

@node ARCHIVE tag, Moving subtrees, Archiving, Archiving
@subsection The ARCHIVE tag
@cindex internal archiving

A headline that is marked with the ARCHIVE tag (@pxref{Tags}) stays at
its location in the outline tree, but behaves in the following way:
@itemize @minus
@item
It does not open when you attempt to do so with a visibility cycling
command (@pxref{Visibility cycling}).  You can force cycling archived
subtrees with @kbd{C-@key{TAB}}, or by setting the option
@code{org-cycle-open-archived-trees}.  Also normal outline commands like
@code{show-all} will open archived subtrees.
@item
During sparse tree construction (@pxref{Sparse trees}), matches in
archived subtrees are not exposed, unless you configure the option
@code{org-sparse-tree-open-archived-trees}.
@item
During agenda view construction (@pxref{Agenda views}), the content of
archived trees is ignored unless you configure the option
@code{org-agenda-skip-archived-trees}.
@item
Archived trees are not exported (@pxref{Exporting}), only the headline
is.  Configure the details using the variable
@code{org-export-with-archived-trees}.
@end itemize

The following commands help managing the ARCHIVE tag:

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c C-x C-a
@item C-c C-x C-a
Toggle the ARCHIVE tag for the current headline.  When the tag is set,
the headline changes to a shadowish face, and the subtree below it is
hidden.
@kindex C-u C-c C-x C-a
@item C-u C-c C-x C-a
Check if any direct children of the current headline should be archived.
To do this, each subtree is checked for open TODO entries.  If none are
found, the command offers to set the ARCHIVE tag for the child.  If the
cursor is @emph{not} on a headline when this command is invoked, the
level 1 trees will be checked.
@kindex C-@kbd{TAB}
@item C-@kbd{TAB}
Cycle a tree even if it is tagged with ARCHIVE.
@end table

@node Moving subtrees,  , ARCHIVE tag, Archiving
@subsection Moving subtrees
@cindex external archiving

Once an entire project is finished, you may want to move it to a
different location, either in the current file, or even in a different
file, the archive file.

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c C-x C-s
@item C-c C-x C-s
Archive the subtree starting at the cursor position to the location
given by @code{org-archive-location}.  Context information that could be
lost like the file name, the category, inherited tags, and the todo
state will be store as properties in the entry.
@kindex C-u C-c C-x C-s
@item C-u C-c C-x C-s
Check if any direct children of the current headline could be moved to
the archive.  To do this, each subtree is checked for open TODO entries.
If none are found, the command offers to move it to the archive
location.  If the cursor is @emph{not} on a headline when this command
is invoked, the level 1 trees will be checked.
@end table

@cindex archive locations
The default archive location is a file in the same directory as the
current file, with the name derived by appending @file{_archive} to the
current file name.  For information and examples on how to change this,
see the documentation string of the variable
@code{org-archive-location}.  There is also an in-buffer option for
setting this variable, for example@footnote{For backward compatibility,
the following also works: If there are several such lines in a file,
each specifies the archive location for the text below it.  The first
such line also applies to any text before its definition.  However,
using this method is @emph{strongly} deprecated as it is incompatible
with the outline structure of the document.  The correct method for
setting multiple archive locations in a buffer is using a property.}:

@example
#+ARCHIVE: %s_done::
@end example

@noindent
If you would like to have a special ARCHIVE location for a single entry
or a (sub)tree, give the entry an @code{:ARCHIVE:} property with the
location as the value (@pxref{Properties and columns}).

@node Sparse trees, Plain lists, Archiving, Document structure
@section Sparse trees
@cindex sparse trees
@cindex trees, sparse
@cindex folding, sparse trees
@cindex occur, command

An important feature of Org-mode is the ability to construct
@emph{sparse trees} for selected information in an outline tree, so that
the entire document is folded as much as possible, but the selected
information is made visible along with the headline structure above
it@footnote{See also the variables @code{org-show-hierarchy-above},
@code{org-show-following-heading}, and @code{org-show-siblings} for
detailed control on how much context is shown around each match.}.  Just
try it out and you will see immediately how it works.

Org-mode contains several commands creating such trees, all these
commands can be accessed through a dispatcher:

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c /
@item C-c /
This prompts for an extra key to select a sparse-tree creating command.
@kindex C-c / r
@item C-c / r
Occur.  Prompts for a regexp and shows a sparse tree with all matches.
If the match is in a headline, the headline is made visible.  If the
match is in the body of an entry, headline and body are made visible.
In order to provide minimal context, also the full hierarchy of
headlines above the match is shown, as well as the headline following
the match.  Each match is also highlighted; the highlights disappear
when the buffer is changed by an editing command, or by pressing
@kbd{C-c C-c}.  When called with a @kbd{C-u} prefix argument, previous
highlights are kept, so several calls to this command can be stacked.
@end table

@noindent
For frequently used sparse trees of specific search strings, you can
use the variable @code{org-agenda-custom-commands} to define fast
keyboard access to specific sparse trees.  These commands will then be
accessible through the agenda dispatcher (@pxref{Agenda dispatcher}).
For example:

@lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("f" occur-tree "FIXME")))
@end lisp

@noindent will define the key @kbd{C-c a f} as a shortcut for creating
a sparse tree matching the string @samp{FIXME}.

The other sparse tree commands select headings based on TODO keywords,
tags, or properties and will be discussed later in this manual.

@kindex C-c C-e v
@cindex printing sparse trees
@cindex visible text, printing
To print a sparse tree, you can use the Emacs command
@code{ps-print-buffer-with-faces} which does not print invisible parts
of the document @footnote{This does not work under XEmacs, because
XEmacs uses selective display for outlining, not text properties.}.
Or you can use the command @kbd{C-c C-e v} to export only the visible
part of the document and print the resulting file.

@node Plain lists, Drawers, Sparse trees, Document structure
@section Plain lists
@cindex plain lists
@cindex lists, plain
@cindex lists, ordered
@cindex ordered lists

Within an entry of the outline tree, hand-formatted lists can provide
additional structure.  They also provide a way to create lists of
checkboxes (@pxref{Checkboxes}).  Org-mode supports editing such lists,
and the HTML exporter (@pxref{Exporting}) parses and formats them.

Org-mode knows ordered and unordered lists.  Unordered list items start
with @samp{-}, @samp{+}, or @samp{*}@footnote{When using @samp{*} as a
bullet, lines must be indented or they will be seen as top-level
headlines.  Also, when you are hiding leading stars to get a clean
outline view, plain list items starting with a star are visually
indistinguishable from true headlines.  In short: even though @samp{*}
is supported, it may be better to not use it for plain list items.} as
bullets.  Ordered list items start with a numeral followed by either a
period or a right parenthesis, such as @samp{1.} or @samp{1)}.  Items
belonging to the same list must have the same indentation on the first
line.  In particular, if an ordered list reaches number @samp{10.}, then
the 2--digit numbers must be written left-aligned with the other numbers
in the list.  Indentation also determines the end of a list item.  It
ends before the next line that is indented like the bullet/number, or
less.  Empty lines are part of the previous item, so you can have
several paragraphs in one item.  If you would like an empty line to
terminate all currently open plain lists, configure the variable
@code{org-empty-line-terminates-plain-lists}.  Here is an example:

@example
@group
** Lord of the Rings
   My favorite scenes are (in this order)
   1. The attack of the Rohirrim
   2. Eowyns fight with the witch king
      + this was already my favorite scene in the book
      + I really like Miranda Otto.
   3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
       - on DVD only
      He makes a really funny face when it happens.
   But in the end, not individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
@end group
@end example

Org-mode supports these lists by tuning filling and wrapping commands to
deal with them correctly@footnote{Org-mode only changes the filling
settings for Emacs.  For XEmacs, you should use Kyle E. Jones'
@file{filladapt.el}.  To turn this on,  put into @file{.emacs}:
@code{(require 'filladapt)}}. 

The following commands act on items when the cursor is in the first line
of an item (the line with the bullet or number).

@table @kbd
@kindex @key{TAB}
@item @key{TAB}
Items can be folded just like headline levels if you set the variable
@code{org-cycle-include-plain-lists}.  The level of an item is then
given by the indentation of the bullet/number.  Items are always
subordinate to real headlines, however; the hierarchies remain
completely separated.

If @code{org-cycle-include-plain-lists} has not been set, @key{TAB}
fixes the indentation of the curent line in a heuristic way.
@kindex M-@key{RET}
@item M-@key{RET}
Insert new item at current level.  With prefix arg, force a new heading
(@pxref{Structure editing}).  If this command is used in the middle of a
line, the line is @emph{split} and the rest of the line becomes the new
item.  If this command is executed in the @emph{whitespace before a bullet or
number}, the new item is created @emph{before} the current item.  If the
command is executed in the white space before the text that is part of
an item but does not contain the bullet, a bullet is added to the
current line.
@kindex M-S-@key{RET}
@item M-S-@key{RET}
Insert a new item with a checkbox (@pxref{Checkboxes}).
@kindex S-@key{up}
@kindex S-@key{down}
@item S-@key{up}
@itemx S-@key{down}
Jump to the previous/next item in the current list.
@kindex M-S-@key{up}
@kindex M-S-@key{down}
@item M-S-@key{up}
@itemx M-S-@key{down}
Move the item including subitems up/down (swap with previous/next item
of same indentation).  If the list is ordered, renumbering is
automatic.
@kindex M-S-@key{left}
@kindex M-S-@key{right}
@item M-S-@key{left}
@itemx M-S-@key{right}
Decrease/increase the indentation of the item, including subitems.
Initially, the item tree is selected based on current indentation.
When these commands are executed several times in direct succession,
the initially selected region is used, even if the new indentation
would imply a different hierarchy.  To use the new hierarchy, break
the command chain with a cursor motion or so.
@kindex C-c C-c
@item C-c C-c
If there is a checkbox (@pxref{Checkboxes}) in the item line, toggle the
state of the checkbox.  If not, this command makes sure that all the
items on this list level use the same bullet.  Furthermore, if this is
an ordered list, make sure the numbering is ok.
@kindex C-c -
@item C-c -
Cycle the entire list level through the different itemize/enumerate
bullets (@samp{-}, @samp{+}, @samp{*}, @samp{1.}, @samp{1)}).
With prefix arg, select the nth bullet from this list.
@end table

@node Drawers, orgstruct-mode, Plain lists, Document structure
@section Drawers
@cindex drawers
@cindex visibility cycling, drawers

Sometimes you want to keep information associated with an entry, but you
normally don't want to see it.  For this, Org-mode has @emph{drawers}.
Drawers need to be configured with the variable
@code{org-drawers}@footnote{You can define drawers on a per-file basis
with a line like @code{#+DRAWERS: HIDDEN PROPERTIES STATE}}.  Drawers
look like this:

@example
** This is a headline
   Still outside the drawer
   :DRAWERNAME:
      This is inside the drawer.
   :END:
   After the drawer.
@end example

Visibility cycling (@pxref{Visibility cycling}) on the headline will
hide and show the entry, but keep the drawer collapsed to a single line.
In order to look inside the drawer, you need to move the cursor to the
drawer line and press @key{TAB} there.  Org-mode uses a drawer for
storing properties (@pxref{Properties and columns}).

@node orgstruct-mode,  , Drawers, Document structure
@section The Orgstruct minor mode
@cindex orgstruct-mode
@cindex minor mode for structure editing

If you like the intuitive way the Org-mode structure editing and list
formatting works, you might want to use these commands in other modes
like text-mode or mail-mode as well.  The minor mode Orgstruct-mode
makes this possible.  You can always toggle the mode with @kbd{M-x
orgstruct-mode}.  To turn it on by default, for example in mail mode,
use

@lisp
(add-hook 'mail-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgstruct)
@end lisp

When this mode is active and the cursor is on a line that looks to
Org-mode like a headline of the first line of a list item, most
structure editing commands will work, even if the same keys normally
have different functionality in the major mode you are using.  If the
cursor is not in one of those special lines, Orgstruct-mode lurks
silently in the shadow.

@cindex table editor, built-in

Org-mode makes it easy to format tables in plain ASCII.  Any line with
@samp{|} as the first non-whitespace character is considered part of a
table.  @samp{|} is also the column separator.  A table might look like
this:

@example
| Name  | Phone | Age |
|-------+-------+-----|
| Peter |  1234 |  17 |
| Anna  |  4321 |  25 |
@end example

A table is re-aligned automatically each time you press @key{TAB} or
@key{RET} or @kbd{C-c C-c} inside the table.  @key{TAB} also moves to
the next field (@key{RET} to the next row) and creates new table rows
at the end of the table or before horizontal lines.  The indentation
of the table is set by the first line.  Any line starting with
@samp{|-} is considered as a horizontal separator line and will be
expanded on the next re-align to span the whole table width.  So, to
create the above table, you would only type

@example
|Name|Phone|Age|
|-
@end example

@noindent and then press @key{TAB} to align the table and start filling in
fields.

When typing text into a field, Org-mode treats @key{DEL},
@key{Backspace}, and all character keys in a special way, so that
inserting and deleting avoids shifting other fields.  Also, when
typing @emph{immediately after the cursor was moved into a new field
with @kbd{@key{TAB}}, @kbd{S-@key{TAB}} or @kbd{@key{RET}}}, the
field is automatically made blank.  If this behavior is too
unpredictable for you, configure the variables
@code{org-enable-table-editor} and @code{org-table-auto-blank-field}.

@table @kbd
@tsubheading{Creation and conversion}
@kindex C-c |
@item C-c |
Convert the active region to table. If every line contains at least one
TAB character, the function assumes that the material is tab separated.
If every line contains a comma, comma-separated values (CSV) are assumed.
If not, lines are split at whitespace into fields.  You can use a prefix
argument to force a specific separator: @kbd{C-u} forces CSV, @kbd{C-u
C-u} forces TAB, and a numeric argument N indicates that at least N
consequtive spaces, or alternatively a TAB will be the separator.
@* 
If there is no active region, this command creates an empty Org-mode
table.  But it's easier just to start typing, like
@kbd{|Name|Phone|Age @key{RET} |- @key{TAB}}.

@tsubheading{Re-aligning and field motion}
@kindex C-c C-c

Sort the table lines in the region.  The position of point indicates the
column to be used for sorting, and the range of lines is the range
between the nearest horizontal separator lines, or the entire table.  If
point is before the first column, you will be prompted for the sorting
column.  If there is an active region, the mark specifies the first line
and the sorting column, while point should be in the last line to be
included into the sorting.  The command prompts for the sorting type
(alphabetically, numerically, or by time).  When called with a prefix
argument, alphabetic sorting will be case-sensitive.

@tsubheading{Regions}
@kindex C-c C-x M-w
@item C-c C-x M-w
Copy a rectangular region from a table to a special clipboard.  Point
and mark determine edge fields of the rectangle.  The process ignores
horizontal separator lines.
@c
@kindex C-c C-x C-w
@item C-c C-x C-w
Copy a rectangular region from a table to a special clipboard, and
blank all fields in the rectangle.  So this is the ``cut'' operation.

@kindex C-c C-x C-y
@item C-c C-x C-y
Paste a rectangular region into a table.
The upper right corner ends up in the current field.  All involved fields

the table is enlarged as needed.  The process ignores horizontal separator
lines.
@c

@item C-c C-q
Wrap several fields in a column like a paragraph.  If there is an active
region, and both point and mark are in the same column, the text in the
column is wrapped to minimum width for the given number of lines.  A
prefix ARG may be used to change the number of desired lines.  If there
is no region, the current field is split at the cursor position and the
text fragment to the right of the cursor is prepended to the field one
line down. If there is no region, but you specify a prefix ARG, the
current field is made blank, and the content is appended to the field
above.

edited in place.
@c
@kindex C-c @key{TAB}
@item C-c @key{TAB}
This is an alias for @kbd{C-u C-c `} to make the current field fully

@c
@item M-x org-table-import
Import a file as a table.  The table should be TAB- or whitespace
separated.  Useful, for example, to import a spreadsheet table or data
from a database, because these programs generally can write
TAB-separated text files.  This command works by inserting the file into
the buffer and then converting the region to a table.  Any prefix
argument is passed on to the converter, which uses it to determine the
separator.
@item C-c |
Tables can also be imported by pasting tabular text into the org-mode
buffer, selecting the pasted text with @kbd{C-x C-x} and then using the
@kbd{C-c |} command (see above under @i{Creation and conversion}.
@c
@item M-x org-table-export
Export the table as a TAB-separated file.  Useful for data exchange with,
for example, spreadsheet or database programs.

@kbd{C-c C-c} to do a manual re-align.

@node Narrow columns, Column groups, Built-in table editor, Tables
@section Narrow columns
@cindex narrow columns in tables

The width of columns is automatically determined by the table editor.
Sometimes a single field or a few fields need to carry more text,
leading to inconveniently wide columns.  To limit@footnote{This feature
does not work on XEmacs.} the width of a column, one field anywhere in
the column may contain just the string @samp{<N>} where @samp{N} is an
integer specifying the width of the column in characters.  The next
re-align will then set the width of this column to no more than this
value.

@example
@group
|---+------------------------------|               |---+--------|
|   |                              |               |   | <6>    |
| 1 | one                          |               | 1 | one    |
| 2 | two                          |     ----\     | 2 | two    |
| 3 | This is a long chunk of text |     ----/     | 3 | This=> |
| 4 | four                         |               | 4 | four   |
|---+------------------------------|               |---+--------|
@end group
@end example

@noindent
Fields that are wider become clipped and end in the string @samp{=>}.
Note that the full text is still in the buffer, it is only invisible.
To see the full text, hold the mouse over the field - a tool-tip window
will show the full content.  To edit such a field, use the command
@kbd{C-c `} (that is @kbd{C-c} followed by the backquote).  This will
open a new window with the full field.  Edit it and finish with @kbd{C-c
C-c}.

When visiting a file containing a table with narrowed columns, the
necessary character hiding has not yet happened, and the table needs to
be aligned before it looks nice.  Setting the option
@code{org-startup-align-all-tables} will realign all tables in a file
upon visiting, but also slow down startup.  You can also set this option
on a per-file basis with:

@example
#+STARTUP: align
#+STARTUP: noalign
@end example

@node Column groups, orgtbl-mode, Narrow columns, Tables
@section Column groups
@cindex grouping columns in tables

When Org-mode exports tables, it does so by default without vertical
lines because that is visually more satisfying in general.  Occasionally
however, vertical lines can be useful to structure a table into groups
of columns, much like horizontal lines can do for groups of rows.  In
order to specify column groups, you can use a special row where the
first field contains only @samp{/}.  The further fields can either
contain @samp{<} to indicate that this column should start a group,
@samp{>} to indicate the end of a column, or @samp{<>} to make a column
a group of its own.  Boundaries between colum groups will upon export be
marked with vertical lines.  Here is an example:

@example
|   |  N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
|---+----+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
| / | <> |   < |     |   > |       < |          > |
| # |  1 |   1 |   1 |   1 |       1 |          1 |
| # |  2 |   4 |   8 |  16 |  1.4142 |     1.1892 |
| # |  3 |   9 |  27 |  81 |  1.7321 |     1.3161 |
|---+----+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
#+TBLFM: $3=$2^2::$4=$2^3::$5=$2^4::$6=sqrt($2)::$7=sqrt(sqrt(($2))
@end example

It is also sufficient to just insert the colum group starters after
every vertical line you'd like to have:

@example
|  N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
|----+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
| /  | <   |     |     | <       |            |

If you like the intuitive way the Org-mode table editor works, you
might also want to use it in other modes like text-mode or mail-mode.
The minor mode Orgtbl-mode makes this possible.  You can always toggle
the mode with @kbd{M-x orgtbl-mode}.  To turn it on by default, for
example in mail mode, use

@lisp

Furthermore, with some special setup, it is possible to maintain tables

construct La@TeX{} tables with the underlying ease and power of
Orgtbl-mode, including spreadsheet capabilities.  For details, see

The table editor makes use of the Emacs @file{calc} package to implement
spreadsheet-like capabilities.  It can also evaluate Emacs Lisp forms to
derive fields from other fields.  While fully featured, Org-mode's
implementation is not identical to other spreadsheets.  For example,
Org-mode knows the concept of a @emph{column formula} that will be
applied to all non-header fields in a column without having to copy the
formula to each relevant field.

@subsection References
@cindex references

To compute fields in the table from other fields, formulas must
reference other fields or ranges.  In Org-mode, fields can be referenced
by name, by absolute coordinates, and by relative coordinates.  To find
out what the coordinates of a field are, press @kbd{C-c ?} in that
field, or press @kbd{C-c @}} to toggle the display of a grid.

@subsubheading Field references
@cindex field references
@cindex references, to fields

Formulas can reference the value of another field in two ways.  Like in
any other spreadsheet, you may reference fields with a letter/number
combination like @code{B3}, meaning the 2nd field in the 3rd row.
@c Such references are always fixed to that field, they don't change
@c when you copy and paste a formula to a different field.  So
@c Org-mode's @code{B3} behaves like @code{$B$3} in other spreadsheets.

@noindent
Org-mode also uses another, more general operator that looks like this:
@example
@@row$column
@end example

@noindent
Column references can be absolute like @samp{1}, @samp{2},...@samp{N},
or relative to the current column like @samp{+1} or @samp{-2}.

The row specification only counts data lines and ignores horizontal
separator lines (hlines).  You can use absolute row numbers
@samp{1}...@samp{N}, and row numbers relative to the current row like
@samp{+3} or @samp{-1}.  Or specify the row relative to one of the
hlines: @samp{I} refers to the first hline@footnote{Note that only
hlines are counted that @emph{separate} table lines.  If the table
starts with a hline above the header, it does not count.}, @samp{II} to
the second etc.  @samp{-I} refers to the first such line above the
current line, @samp{+I} to the first such line below the current line.
You can also write @samp{III+2} which is the second data line after the
third hline in the table.  Relative row numbers like @samp{-3} will not
cross hlines if the current line is too close to the hline.  Instead,
the value directly at the hline is used.

@samp{0} refers to the current row and column.  Also, if you omit
either the column or the row part of the reference, the current
row/column is implied. 

Org-mode's references with @emph{unsigned} numbers are fixed references
in the sense that if you use the same reference in the formula for two
different fields, the same field will be referenced each time.
Org-mode's references with @emph{signed} numbers are floating
references because the same reference operator can reference different
fields depending on the field being calculated by the formula.

Here are a few examples:

@example
@@2$3      @r{2nd row, 3rd column}
C2        @r{same as previous}
$5        @r{column 5 in the current row}
E&        @r{same as previous}
@@2        @r{current column, row 2}
@@-1$-3    @r{the field one row up, three columns to the left}
@@-I$2     @r{field just under hline above current row, column 2}
@end example

@subsubheading Range references
@cindex range references
@cindex references, to ranges

You may reference a rectangular range of fields by specifying two field
references connected by two dots @samp{..}.  If both fields are in the
current row, you may simply use @samp{$2..$7}, but if at least one field
is in a different row, you need to use the general @code{@@row$column}
format at least for the first field (i.e the reference must start with
@samp{@@} in order to be interpreted correctly).  Examples:

@example
$1..$3        @r{First three fields in the current row.}
$P..$Q        @r{Range, using column names (see under Advanced)}
@@2$1..@@4$3    @r{6 fields between these two fields.}
A2..C4        @r{Same as above.}
@@-1$-2..@@-1   @r{3 numbers from the column to the left, 2 up to current row}
@end example

@noindent Range references return a vector of values that can be fed
into Calc vector functions.  Empty fields in ranges are normally
suppressed, so that the vector contains only the non-empty fields (but
see the @samp{E} mode switch below).  If there are no non-empty fields,
@samp{[0]} is returned to avoid syntax errors in formulas.

@subsubheading Named references
@cindex named references
@cindex references, named
@cindex name, of column or field
@cindex constants, in calculations

@samp{$name} is interpreted as the name of a column, parameter or
constant.  Constants are defined globally through the variable
@code{org-table-formula-constants}, and locally (for the file) through a
line like

@example
#+CONSTANTS: c=299792458. pi=3.14 eps=2.4e-6
@end example

@noindent
Also properties (@pxref{Properties and columns}) can be used as
constants in table formulas: For a property @samp{:XYZ:} use the name
@samp{$PROP_XYZ}, and the property will be searched in the current
outline entry and in the hierarchy above it.  If you have the
@file{constants.el} package, it will also be used to resolve constants,
including natural constants like @samp{$h} for Planck's constant, and
units like @samp{$km} for kilometers@footnote{@file{Constant.el} can
supply the values of constants in two different unit systems, @code{SI}
and @code{cgs}.  Which one is used depends on the value of the variable
@code{constants-unit-system}.  You can use the @code{#+STARTUP} options
@code{constSI} and @code{constcgs} to set this value for the current
buffer.}.  Column names and parameters can be specified in special table
lines.  These are described below, see @ref{Advanced features}.  All
names must start with a letter, and further consist of letters and
numbers.

variable substitution takes place according to the rules described above.
@cindex vectors, in table calculations
The range vectors can be directly fed into the calc vector functions
like @samp{vmean} and @samp{vsum}.

@cindex format specifier
@cindex mode, for @file{calc}
A formula can contain an optional mode string after a semicolon.  This
string consists of flags to influence Calc and other modes during
execution.  By default, Org-mode uses the standard calc modes (precision
12, angular units degrees, fraction and symbolic modes off.  The display
format, however, has been changed to @code{(float 5)} to keep tables
compact.  The default settings can be configured using the variable
@code{org-calc-default-modes}.

@example
p20           @r{switch the internal precision to 20 digits}
n3 s3 e2 f4   @r{normal, scientific, engineering, or fixed display format}
D R           @r{angle modes: degrees, radians}
F S           @r{fraction and symbolic modes}
N             @r{interpret all fields as numbers, use 0 for non-numbers}
T             @r{force text interpretation}
E             @r{keep empty fields in ranges}
@end example

@noindent
In addition, you may provide a @code{printf} format specifier to
reformat the final result.  A few examples:

@example
$1+$2                @r{Sum of first and second field}
$1+$2;%.2f           @r{Same, format result to two decimals}
exp($2)+exp($1)      @r{Math functions can be used}
$0;%.1f              @r{Reformat current cell to 1 decimal}
($3-32)*5/9          @r{Degrees F -> C conversion}
$c/$1/$cm            @r{Hz -> cm conversion, using @file{constants.el}}
tan($1);Dp3s1        @r{Compute in degrees, precision 3, display SCI 1}
sin($1);Dp3%.1e      @r{Same, but use printf specifier for display}
vmean($2..$7)        @r{Compute column range mean, using vector function}
vmean($2..$7);EN     @r{Same, but treat empty fields as 0}
taylor($3,x=7,2)     @r{taylor series of $3, at x=7, second degree}
@end example

Calc also contains a complete set of logical operations.  For example

@example
if($1<20,teen,string(""))  @r{``teen'' if age $1 less than 20, else empty}
@end example

@node Formula syntax for Lisp, Field formulas, Formula syntax for Calc, The spreadsheet
@subsection Emacs Lisp forms as formulas
@cindex Lisp forms, as table formulas

It is also possible to write a formula in Emacs Lisp; this can be useful
for string manipulation and control structures, if the Calc's
functionality is not enough.  If a formula starts with a single quote
followed by an opening parenthesis, then it is evaluated as a lisp form.
The evaluation should return either a string or a number.  Just as with
@file{calc} formulas, you can specify modes and a printf format after a
semicolon.  With Emacs Lisp forms, you need to be concious about the way
field references are interpolated into the form.  By default, a
reference will be interpolated as a Lisp string (in double quotes)
containing the field.  If you provide the @samp{N} mode switch, all
referenced elements will be numbers (non-number fields will be zero) and
interpolated as Lisp numbers, without quotes.  If you provide the
@samp{L} flag, all fields will be interpolated literally, without quotes.
I.e., if you want a reference to be interpreted as a string by the Lisp
form, enclode the reference operator itself in double quotes, like
@code{"$3"}.  Ranges are inserted as space-separated fields, so you can
embed them in list or vector syntax.  A few examples, note how the
@samp{N} mode is used when we do computations in lisp.

@example
@r{Swap the first two characters of the content of column 1}
  '(concat (substring $1 1 2) (substring $1 0 1) (substring $1 2))
@r{Add columns 1 and 2, equivalent to the Calc's @code{$1+$2}}
  '(+ $1 $2);N
@r{Compute the sum of columns 1-4, like Calc's @code{vsum($1..$4)}}
  '(apply '+ '($1..$4));N

@subsection Field formulas
@cindex field formula
@cindex formula, for individual table field

To assign a formula to a particular field, type it directly into the
field, preceded by @samp{:=}, for example @samp{:=$1+$2}.  When you
press @key{TAB} or @key{RET} or @kbd{C-c C-c} with the cursor still in
the field, the formula will be stored as the formula for this field,
evaluated, and the current field replaced with the result.

Formulas are stored in a special line starting with @samp{#+TBLFM:}
directly below the table.  If you typed the equation in the 4th field of
the 3rd data line in the table, the formula will look like
@samp{@@3$4=$1+$2}.  When inserting/deleting/swapping column and rows
with the appropriate commands, @i{absolute references} (but not relative
ones) in stored formulas are modified in order to still reference the
same field.  Of cause this is not true if you edit the table structure
with normal editing commands - then you must fix the equations yourself.

Instead of typing an equation into the field, you may also use the
following command

@table @kbd
@kindex C-u C-c =
@item C-u C-c =
Install a new formula for the current field.  The command prompts for a
formula, with default taken from the @samp{#+TBLFM:} line, applies
it to the current field and stores it.

@node Column formulas, Editing and debugging formulas, Field formulas, The spreadsheet
@subsection Column formulas
@cindex column formula
@cindex formula, for table column

Often in a table, the same formula should be used for all fields in a
particular column.  Instead of having to copy the formula to all fields
in that column, org-mode allows to assign a single formula to an entire
column.  If the table contains horizontal separator hlines, everything
before the first such line is considered part of the table @emph{header}
and will not be modified by column formulas.

To assign a formula to a column, type it directly into any field in the
column, preceded by an equal sign, like @samp{=$1+$2}.  When you press
@key{TAB} or @key{RET} or @kbd{C-c C-c} with the cursor still in the
field, the formula will be stored as the formula for the current column,
evaluated and the current field replaced with the result.  If the field
contains only @samp{=}, the previously stored formula for this column is
used.  For each column, Org-mode will only remember the most recently
used formula.  In the @samp{TBLFM:} line, column formulas will look like
@samp{$4=$1+$2}.

Instead of typing an equation into the field, you may also use the
following command:

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c =
@item C-c =
Install a new formula for the current column and replace current field
with the result of the formula.  The command prompts for a formula, with
default taken from the @samp{#+TBLFM} line, applies it to the current
field and stores it.  With a numerical prefix (e.g. @kbd{C-5 C-c =})
will apply it to that many consecutive fields in the current column.

@kindex C-c '
@item C-c '
Edit all formulas for the current table in a special buffer, where the
formulas will be displayed one per line.  If the current field has an
active formula, the cursor in the formula editor will mark it.
While inside the special buffer, Org-mode will automatically highlight
any field or range reference at the cursor position.  You may edit,
remove and add formulas, and use the following commands:
@table @kbd
@kindex C-c C-c
@kindex C-x C-s
@item C-c C-c
@itemx C-x C-s
Exit the formula editor and store the modified formulas.  With @kbd{C-u}
prefix, also apply the new formulas to the entire table.
@kindex C-c C-q
@item C-c C-q
Exit the formula editor without installing changes.
@kindex C-c C-r
@item C-c C-r
Toggle all references in the formula editor between standard (like
@code{B3}) and internal (like @code{@@3$2}).
@kindex @key{TAB}
@item @key{TAB}
Pretty-print or indent lisp formula at point.  When in a line containing
a lisp formula, format the formula according to Emacs Lisp rules.
Another @key{TAB} collapses the formula back again.  In the open
formula, @key{TAB} re-indents just like in Emacs-lisp-mode.
@kindex M-@key{TAB}
@item M-@key{TAB}
Complete Lisp symbols, just like in Emacs-lisp-mode.
@kindex S-@key{up}
@kindex S-@key{down}
@kindex S-@key{left}
@kindex S-@key{right}
@item S-@key{up}/@key{down}/@key{left}/@key{right}
Shift the reference at point.  For example, if the reference is
@code{B3} and you press @kbd{S-@key{right}}, it will become @code{C3}.
This also works for relative references, and for hline references.
@kindex M-S-@key{up}
@kindex M-S-@key{down}
@item M-S-@key{up}/@key{down}
Move the test line for column formulas in the Org-mode buffer up and
down.
@kindex M-@key{up}
@kindex M-@key{down}
@item M-@key{up}/@key{down}
Scroll the window displaying the table.
@kindex C-c @}
@item C-c @}
Turn the coordinate grid in the table on and off.
@end table
@end table

Making a table field blank does not remove the formula associated with
the field, because that is stored in a different line (the @samp{TBLFM}
line) - during the next recalculation the field will be filled again.
To remove a formula from a field, you have to give an empty reply when
prompted for the formula, or to edit the @samp{#+TBLFM} line.

@kindex C-c C-c
You may edit the @samp{#+TBLFM} directly and re-apply the changed
equations with @kbd{C-c C-c} in that line, or with the normal
recalculation commands in the table.

@subsubheading Debugging formulas
@cindex formula debugging
@cindex debugging, of table formulas
When the evaluation of a formula leads to an error, the field content
becomes the string @samp{#ERROR}.  If you would like see what is going
on during variable substitution and calculation in order to find a bug,
turn on formula debugging in the @code{Tbl} menu and repeat the
calculation, for example by pressing @kbd{C-u C-u C-c = @key{RET}} in a
field.  Detailed information will be displayed.

@cindex recomputing table fields
@cindex updating, table

Recalculation of a table is normally not automatic, but needs to be
triggered by a command.  See @ref{Advanced features} for a way to make
recalculation at least semi-automatically.

In order to recalculate a line of a table or the entire table, use the
following commands:

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c *
@item C-c *
Recalculate the current row by first applying the stored column formulas
from left to right, and all field formulas in the current row.
@c
@kindex C-u C-c *
@item C-u C-c *
@kindex C-u C-c C-c
@itemx C-u C-c C-c
Recompute the entire table, line by line.  Any lines before the first
hline are left alone, assuming that these are part of the table header.
@c
@kindex C-u C-u C-c *
@kindex C-u C-u C-c C-c
@item C-u C-u C-c *
@itemx C-u C-u C-c C-c
Iterate the table by recomputing it until no further changes occur.
This may be necessary if some computed fields use the value of other
fields that are computed @i{later} in the calculation sequence.
@end table

@node Advanced features,  , Updating the table, The spreadsheet
@subsection Advanced features

If you want the recalculation of fields to happen automatically, or if
you want to be able to assign @i{names} to fields and columns, you need
to reserve the first column of the table for special marking characters.
@table @kbd
@kindex C-#
@item C-#
Rotate the calculation mark in first column through the states @samp{},
@samp{#}, @samp{*}, @samp{!}, @samp{$}.  The meaning of these characters
is discussed below.  When there is an active region, change all marks in
the region.
@end table

Here is an example of a table that collects exam results of students and
makes use of these features:

@example
@group

@end group
@end example

@noindent @b{Important}: Please note that for these special tables,
recalculating the table with @kbd{C-u C-c *} will only affect rows that
are marked @samp{#} or @samp{*}, and fields that have a formula assigned
to the field itself.  The column formulas are not applied in rows with
empty first field.

@cindex marking characters, tables
The marking characters have the following meaning:
@table @samp
@item !
The fields in this line define names for the columns, so that you may
refer to a column as @samp{$Tot} instead of @samp{$6}.
@item ^
This row defines names for the fields @emph{above} the row.  With such
a definition, any formula in the table may use @samp{$m1} to refer to
the value @samp{10}.  Also, if you assign a formula to a names field, it
will be stored as @samp{$name=...}.
@item _
Similar to @samp{^}, but defines names for the fields in the row
@emph{below}.
@item $
Fields in this row can define @emph{parameters} for formulas.  For
example, if a field in a @samp{$} row contains @samp{max=50}, then
formulas in this table can refer to the value 50 using @samp{$max}.
Parameters work exactly like constants, only that they can be defined on
a per-table basis.
@item #
Fields in this row are automatically recalculated when pressing
@key{TAB} or @key{RET} or @kbd{S-@key{TAB}} in this row.  Also, this row
is selected for a global recalculation with @kbd{C-u C-c *}.  Unmarked
lines will be left alone by this command.
@item *
Selects this line for global recalculation with @kbd{C-u C-c *}, but
not for automatic recalculation.  Use this when automatic
recalculation slows down editing too much.
@item
Unmarked lines are exempt from recalculation with @kbd{C-u C-c *}.
All lines that should be recalculated should be marked with @samp{#}
or @samp{*}.
@item /
Do not export this line.  Useful for lines that contain the narrowing
@samp{<N>} markers.
@end table

Finally, just to whet your appetite on what can be done with the
fantastic @file{calc} package, here is a table that computes the Taylor

@cindex format, of links

Org-mode will recognize plain URL-like links and activate them as
clickable links.  The general link format, however, looks like this:

@example
[[link][description]]       @r{or alternatively}           [[link]]  
@end example

Once a link in the buffer is complete (all brackets present), Org-mode
will change the display so that @samp{description} is displayed instead
of @samp{[[link][description]]} and @samp{link} is displayed instead of
@samp{[[link]]}.  Links will be highlighted in the face @code{org-link},
which by default is an underlined face.  You can directly edit the
visible part of a link.  Note that this can be either the @samp{link}
part (if there is no description) or the @samp{description} part.  To
edit also the invisible @samp{link} part, use @kbd{C-c C-l} with the
cursor on the link.

If you place the cursor at the beginning or just behind the end of the
displayed text and press @key{BACKSPACE}, you will remove the
(invisible) bracket at that location.  This makes the link incomplete
and the internals are again displayed as plain text.  Inserting the
missing bracket hides the link internals again.  To show the
internal structure of all links, use the menu entry
@code{Org->Hyperlinks->Literal links}.

@node Internal links, External links, Link format, Hyperlinks
@section Internal links
@cindex internal links
@cindex links, internal
@cindex targets, for links

If the link does not look like a URL, it is considered to be internal in
the current file.  Links such as @samp{[[My Target]]} or @samp{[[My
Target][Find my target]]} lead to a text search in the current file.
The link can be followed with @kbd{C-c C-o} when the cursor is on the
link, or with a mouse click (@pxref{Handling links}).  The preferred
match for such a link is a dedicated target: the same string in double
angular brackets.  Targets may be located anywhere; sometimes it is
convenient to put them into a comment line. For example

@example
# <<My Target>>
@end example

@noindent In HTML export (@pxref{HTML export}), such targets will become
named anchors for direct access through @samp{http} links@footnote{Note
that text before the first headline is usually not exported, so the
first such target should be after the first headline.}.

If no dedicated target exists, Org-mode will search for the words in the
link.  In the above example the search would be for @samp{my target}.
Links starting with a star like @samp{*My Target} restrict the search to
headlines.  When searching, Org-mode will first try an exact match, but
then move on to more and more lenient searches.  For example, the link
@samp{[[*My Targets]]} will find any of the following:

@example
** My targets
** TODO my targets are bright
** my 20 targets are
@end example

To insert a link targeting a headline, in-buffer completion can be used.
Just type a star followed by a few optional letters into the buffer and
press @kbd{M-@key{TAB}}.  All headlines in the current buffer will be
offered as completions.  @xref{Handling links}, for more commands
creating links.

Following a link pushes a mark onto Org-mode's own mark ring.  You can
return to the previous position with @kbd{C-c &}.  Using this command
several times in direct succession goes back to positions recorded
earlier.

Org-mode can automatically turn any occurrences of certain target names
in normal text into a link.  So without explicitly creating a link, the
text connects to the target radioing its position.  Radio targets are
enclosed by triple angular brackets.  For example, a target @samp{<<<My
Target>>>} causes each occurrence of @samp{my target} in normal text to
become activated as a link.  The Org-mode file is scanned automatically
for radio targets only when the file is first loaded into Emacs.  To
update the target list during editing, press @kbd{C-c C-c} with the
cursor on or at a target.

start with a short identifying string followed by a colon.  There can be
no space after the colon.  The following list shows examples for each
link type.

A link should be enclosed in double brackets and may contain a
descriptive text to be displayed instead of the url (@pxref{Link
format}), for example:

@example
[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]
@end example

@noindent
If the description is a file name or URL that points to an image, HTML
export (@pxref{HTML export}) will inline the image as a clickable
button.  If there is no description at all and the link points to an
image,
that image will be inlined into the exported HTML file.

@cindex angular brackets, around links
@cindex plain text external links
Org-mode also finds external links in the normal text and activates them
as links.  If spaces must be part of the link (for example in
@samp{bbdb:Richard Stallman}), or if you need to remove ambiguities
about the end of the link, enclose them in angular brackets.

@node Handling links, Using links outside Org-mode, External links, Hyperlinks
@section Handling links
@cindex links, handling

Org-mode provides methods to create a link in the correct syntax, to
insert it into an org-mode file, and to follow the link.

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c l
@cindex storing links
@item C-c l
Store a link to the current location.  This is a @emph{global} command
which can be used in any buffer to create a link.  The link will be
stored for later insertion into an Org-mode buffer (see below).  For
Org-mode files, if there is a @samp{<<target>>} at the cursor, the link
points to the target.  Otherwise it points to the current headline.  For
VM, RMAIL, WANDERLUST, MH-E, GNUS and BBDB buffers, the link will
indicate the current article/entry.  For W3 and W3M buffers, the link
goes to the current URL.  For any other files, the link will point to
the file, with a search string (@pxref{Search options}) pointing to the
contents of the current line.  If there is an active region, the
selected words will form the basis of the search string.  If the
automatically created link is not working correctly or accurately
enough, you can write custom functions to select the search string and
to do the search for particular file types - see @ref{Custom searches}.
The key binding @kbd{C-c l} is only a suggestion - see @ref{Installation}.
@c
@kindex C-c C-l
@cindex link completion
@cindex completion, of links
@cindex inserting links
@item C-c C-l
Insert a link.  This prompts for a link to be inserted into the buffer.
You can just type a link, using text for an internal link, or one of the
link type prefixes mentioned in the examples above.  All links stored
during the current session are part of the history for this prompt, so
you can access them with @key{up} and @key{down} (or @kbd{M-p/n}).
Completion, on the other hand, will help you to insert valid link
prefixes like @samp{http:} or @samp{ftp:}, including the prefixes
defined through link abbreviations (@pxref{Link abbreviations}).  The
link will be inserted into the buffer@footnote{After insertion of a
stored link, the link will be removed from the list of stored links.  To
keep it in the list later use, use a triple @kbd{C-u} prefix to @kbd{C-c
C-l}, or configure the option
@code{org-keep-stored-link-after-insertion}.}, along with a descriptive
text.  If some text was selected when this command is called, the
selected text becomes the default description.@* Note that you don't
have to use this command to insert a link.  Links in Org-mode are plain
text, and you can type or paste them straight into the buffer.  By using
this command, the links are automatically enclosed in double brackets,
and you will be asked for the optional descriptive text.
@c
@c  If the link is a @samp{file:} link and
@c the linked file is located in the same directory as the current file or
@c a subdirectory of it, the path of the file will be inserted relative to
@c the current directory.
@c
@kindex C-u C-c C-l
@cindex file name completion
@cindex completion, of file names
@item C-u C-c C-l
When @kbd{C-c C-l} is called with a @kbd{C-u} prefix argument, a link to
a file will be inserted and you may use file name completion to select
the name of the file.  The path to the file is inserted relative to the
directory of the current org file, if the linked file is in the current
directory or in a subdirectory of it, or if the path is written relative
to the current directory using @samp{../}.  Otherwise an absolute path
is used, if possible with @samp{~/} for your home directory.  You can
force an absolute path with two @kbd{C-u} prefixes.
@c
@item C-c C-l @r{(with cursor on existing link)}
When the cursor is on an existing link, @kbd{C-c C-l} allows you to edit the
link and description parts of the link.
@c
@cindex following links
@kindex C-c C-o
@item C-c C-o
Open link at point.  This will launch a web browser for URLs (using
@command{browse-url-at-point}), run vm/mh-e/wanderlust/rmail/gnus/bbdb
for the corresponding links, and execute the command in a shell link.
When the cursor is on an internal link, this commands runs the
corresponding search.  When the cursor is on a TAG list in a headline,
it creates the corresponding TAGS view.  If the cursor is on a time
stamp, it compiles the agenda for that date.  Furthermore, it will visit
text and remote files in @samp{file:} links with Emacs and select a
suitable application for local non-text files.  Classification of files
is based on file extension only.  See option @code{org-file-apps}.  If
you want to override the default application and visit the file with
Emacs, use a @kbd{C-u} prefix.
@c
@kindex mouse-2
@kindex mouse-1
@item mouse-2
@itemx mouse-1
On links, @kbd{mouse-2} will open the link just as @kbd{C-c C-o}
would.  Under Emacs 22, also @kbd{mouse-1} will follow a link.
@c
@kindex mouse-3
@item mouse-3
Like @kbd{mouse-2}, but force file links to be opened with Emacs, and
internal links to be displayed in another window@footnote{See the
variable @code{org-display-internal-link-with-indirect-buffer}}.
@c
@cindex mark ring
@kindex C-c %
@item C-c %
Push the current position onto the mark ring, to be able to return
easily. Commands following an internal link do this automatically.
@c
@cindex links, returning to
@kindex C-c &
@item C-c &
Jump back to a recorded position.  A position is recorded by the
commands following internal links, and by @kbd{C-c %}.  Using this
command several times in direct succession moves through a ring of
previously recorded positions.
@c
@kindex C-c C-x C-n
@kindex C-c C-x C-p
@cindex links, finding next/previous
@item C-c C-x C-n
@itemx C-c C-x C-p
Move forward/backward to the next link in the buffer.  At the limit of
the buffer, the search fails once, and then wraps around.  The key
bindings for this are really too long, you might want to bind this also
to @kbd{C-n} and @kbd{C-p}

If the replacement text contains the string @samp{%s}, it will be
replaced with the tag.  Otherwise the tag will be appended to the string
in order to create the link.  You may also specify a function that will
be called with the tag as the only argument to create the link.

With the above setting, you could link to a specific bug with
@code{[[bugzilla:129]]}, search the web for @samp{OrgMode} with
@code{[[google:OrgMode]]} and find out what the Org-mode author is
doing besides Emacs hacking with @code{[[ads:Dominik,C]]}.

If you need special abbreviations just for a single Org-mode buffer, you
can define them in the file with

@example
#+LINK: bugzilla  http://10.1.2.9/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=
#+LINK: google    http://www.google.com/search?q=%s
@end example

@noindent
In-buffer completion @pxref{Completion} can be used after @samp{[} to
complete link abbreviations.

@node Search options, Custom searches, Link abbreviations, Hyperlinks
@section Search options in file links
@cindex search option in file links
@cindex file links, searching

File links can contain additional information to make Emacs jump to a
particular location in the file when following a link.  This can be a
line number or a search option after a double@footnote{For backward
compatibility, line numbers can also follow a single colon.} colon. For
example, when the command @kbd{C-c l} creates a link (@pxref{Handling
links}) to a file, it encodes the words in the current line as a search
string that can be used to find this line back later when following the
link with @kbd{C-c C-o}. 

Here is the syntax of the different ways to attach a search to a file
link, together with an explanation:

@example
[[file:~/code/main.c::255]]
[[file:~/xx.org::My Target]]
[[file:~/xx.org::*My Target]]
[[file:~/xx.org::/regexp/]]
@end example

@table @code
@item 255
Jump to line 255.
@item My Target
Search for a link target @samp{<<My Target>>}, or do a text search for
@samp{my target}, similar to the search in internal links, see
@ref{Internal links}.  In HTML export (@pxref{HTML export}), such a file
link will become an HTML reference to the corresponding named anchor in
the linked file.
@item *My Target
In an Org-mode file, restrict search to headlines.
@item /regexp/
Do a regular expression search for @code{regexp}.  This uses the Emacs
command @code{occur} to list all matches in a separate window.  If the
target file is in Org-mode, @code{org-occur} is used to create a
sparse tree with the matches.
@c If the target file is a directory,
@c @code{grep} will be used to search all files in the directory.
@end table

As a degenerate case, a file link with an empty file name can be used
to search the current file.  For example, @code{[[file:::find me]]} does
a search for @samp{find me} in the current file, just as
@samp{[[find me]]} would.

@node Custom searches,  , Search options, Hyperlinks
@section Custom Searches
@cindex custom search strings
@cindex search strings, custom

The default mechanism for creating search strings and for doing the
actual search related to a file link may not work correctly in all
cases.  For example, BibTeX database files have many entries like
@samp{year="1993"} which would not result in good search strings,
because the only unique identification for a BibTeX entry is the
citation key.

If you come across such a problem, you can write custom functions to set
the right search string for a particular file type, and to do the search
for the string in the file.  Using @code{add-hook}, these functions need
to be added to the hook variables
@code{org-create-file-search-functions} and
@code{org-execute-file-search-functions}.  See the docstring for these
variables for more information.  Org-mode actually uses this mechanism
for Bib@TeX{} database files, and you can use the corresponding code as
an implementation example.  Search for @samp{BibTeX links} in the source
file.

@chapter TODO items
@cindex TODO items

Org-mode does not maintain TODO lists as separate documents.  Instead,
TODO items are an integral part of the notes file, because TODO items
usually come up while taking notes!  With Org-mode, simply mark any
entry in a tree as being a TODO item.  In this way, information is not
duplicated, and the entire context from which the TODO item emerged is
always present.

Of course, this technique for managing TODO items scatters them
throughout your notes file.  Org-mode compensates for this by providing
methods to give you an overview of all the things that you have to do.

@section Basic TODO functionality

Any headline becomes a TODO item when it starts with the word
@samp{TODO}, for example:

@example
*** TODO Write letter to Sam Fortune
@end example

@noindent
The most important commands to work with TODO entries are:

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c C-t
@cindex cycling, of TODO states
@item C-c C-t
Rotate the TODO state of the current item among

@example
,-> (unmarked) -> TODO -> DONE --.
'--------------------------------'
@end example

The same rotation can also be done ``remotely'' from the timeline and
agenda buffers with the @kbd{t} command key (@pxref{Agenda commands}).

@kindex C-u C-c C-t
@item C-u C-c C-t
Select a specific keyword using completion or (if it has been set up)
the fast selection interface.

@kindex S-@key{right}
@kindex S-@key{left}
@item S-@key{right}
@itemx S-@key{left}
Select the following/preceding TODO state, similar to cycling.  Useful
mostly if more than two TODO states are possible (@pxref{TODO
extensions}).
@kindex C-c C-c
@item C-c C-c
Use the fast tag interface to directly select a specific TODO state.
For this you need to assign keys to TODO states, like this:
@example
#+SEQ_TODO: TODO(t) STARTED(s) WAITING(w) | DONE(d)
@end example
@noindent See @ref{Per-file keywords} and @ref{Setting tags} for more
information.
@kindex C-c C-v
@kindex C-c / t
@cindex sparse tree, for TODO
@item C-c C-v
@itemx C-c / t
View TODO items in a @emph{sparse tree} (@pxref{Sparse trees}).  Folds
the entire buffer, but shows all TODO items and the headings hierarchy
above them.  With prefix arg, search for a specific TODO.  You will be
prompted for the keyword, and you can also give a list of keywords like
@code{kwd1|kwd2|...}.  With numerical prefix N, show the tree for the
Nth keyword in the variable @code{org-todo-keywords}.  With two prefix
args, find all TODO and DONE entries.
@kindex C-c a t
@item C-c a t
Show the global TODO list.  Collects the TODO items from all agenda
files (@pxref{Agenda views}) into a single buffer.  The new buffer will
be in @code{agenda-mode}, which provides commands to examine and
manipulate the TODO entries from the new buffer (@pxref{Agenda
commands}).  @xref{Global TODO list}, for more information.
@kindex S-M-@key{RET}
@item S-M-@key{RET}
Insert a new TODO entry below the current one.

By default, marked TODO entries have one of only two states: TODO and
DONE.  Org-mode allows you to classify TODO items in more complex ways
with @emph{TODO keywords} (stored in @code{org-todo-keywords}).  With
special setup, the TODO keyword system can work differently in different
files.

Note that @i{tags} are another way to classify headlines in general and
TODO items in particular (@pxref{Tags}).

@subsection TODO keywords as workflow states
@cindex TODO workflow
@cindex workflow states as TODO keywords

You can use TODO keywords to indicate different @emph{sequential} states
in the process of working on an item, for example@footnote{Changing
this variable only becomes effective after restarting Org-mode in a
buffer.}:

@lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
  '((sequence "TODO" "FEEDBACK" "VERIFY" "|" "DONE" "DELEGATED")))
@end lisp

The vertical bar separates the TODO keywords (states that @emph{need
action}) from the DONE states (which need @emph{no further action}.  If
you don't provide the separator bar, the last state is used as the DONE
state.
@cindex completion, of TODO keywords
With this setup, the command @kbd{C-c C-t} will cycle an entry from TODO
to FEEDBACK, then to VERIFY, and finally to DONE and DELEGATED.  You may
also use a prefix argument to quickly select a specific state.  For
example @kbd{C-3 C-c C-t} will change the state immediately to VERIFY.
If you define many keywords, you can use in-buffer completion (see
@ref{Completion}) to insert these words into the buffer.  Changing a
todo state can be logged with a timestamp, see @ref{Tracking TODO state
changes} for more information.

@node TODO types, Multiple sets in one file, Workflow states, TODO extensions
@subsection TODO keywords as types
@cindex TODO types
@cindex names as TODO keywords
@cindex types as TODO keywords

The second possibility is to use TODO keywords to indicate different
@emph{types} of action items.  For example, you might want to indicate
that items are for ``work'' or ``home''.  Or, when you work with several
people on a single project, you might want to assign action items
directly to persons, by using their names as TODO keywords.  This would
be set up like this:

@lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords '((type "Fred" "Sara" "Lucy" "|" "DONE")))
@end lisp

In this case, different keywords do not indicate a sequence, but rather
different types.  So the normal work flow would be to assign a task to a
person, and later to mark it DONE.  Org-mode supports this style by
adapting the workings of the command @kbd{C-c C-t}@footnote{This is also
true for the @kbd{t} command in the timeline and agenda buffers.}.  When
used several times in succession, it will still cycle through all names,
in order to first select the right type for a task.  But when you return
to the item after some time and execute @kbd{C-c C-t} again, it will
switch from any name directly to DONE.  Use prefix arguments or
completion to quickly select a specific name.  You can also review the
items of a specific TODO type in a sparse tree by using a numeric prefix
to @kbd{C-c C-v}.  For example, to see all things Lucy has to do, you
would use @kbd{C-3 C-c C-v}.  To collect Lucy's items from all agenda
files into a single buffer, you would use the prefix arg as well when
creating the global todo list: @kbd{C-3 C-c t}.

@node Multiple sets in one file, Fast access to TODO states, TODO types, TODO extensions
@subsection Multiple keyword sets in one file
@cindex todo keyword sets

Sometimes you may want to use different sets of TODO keywords in
parallel.  For example, you may want to have the basic
@code{TODO}/@code{DONE}, but also a workflow for bug fixing, and a
separate state indicating that an item has been canceled (so it is not
DONE, but also does not require action).  Your setup would then look
like this:

@lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
      '((sequence "TODO" "|" "DONE")
        (sequence "REPORT" "BUG" "KNOWNCAUSE" "|" "FIXED")
        (sequence "|" "CANCELED")))
@end lisp

The keywords should all be different, this helps Org-mode to keep track
of which subsequence should be used for a given entry.  In this setup,
@kbd{C-c C-t} only operates within a subsequence, so it switches from
@code{DONE} to (nothing) to @code{TODO}, and from @code{FIXED} to
(nothing) to @code{REPORT}.  Therefore you need a mechanism to initially
select the correct sequence.  Besides the obvious ways like typing a
keyword or using completion, you may also apply the following commands:

@table @kbd
@kindex C-S-@key{right}
@kindex C-S-@key{left}
@item C-S-@key{right}
@itemx C-S-@key{left}
These keys jump from one TODO subset to the next.  In the above example,
@kbd{C-S-@key{right}} would jump from @code{TODO} or @code{DONE} to
@code{REPORT}, and any of the words in the second row to @code{CANCELED}.
@kindex S-@key{right}
@kindex S-@key{left}
@item S-@key{right}
@itemx S-@key{left}
@kbd{S-@key{<left>}} and @kbd{S-@key{<right>}} and walk through
@emph{all} keywords from all sets, so for example @kbd{S-@key{<right>}}
would switch from @code{DONE} to @code{REPORT} in the example above.
@end table

@node Fast access to TODO states, Per-file keywords, Multiple sets in one file, TODO extensions
@subsection Fast access to TODO states

If you would like to quickly change an entry to an arbitrary TODO state
instead of cycling through the states, you can set up keys for
single-letter access to the states.  This is done by adding the section
key after each keyword, in parenthesis.  For example:

@lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
      '((sequence "TODO(t)" "|" "DONE(d)")
        (sequence "REPORT(r)" "BUG(b)" "KNOWNCAUSE(k)" "|" "FIXED(f)")
        (sequence "|" "CANCELED(c)")))
@end lisp

If you then press @code{C-u C-c C-t} followed by the selection key, the
entry will be switched to this state.  @key{SPC} can be used to remove
any TODO keyword from an entry.  Should you like this way of selecting
TODO states a lot, you might want to set the variable
@code{org-use-fast-todo-selection} to @code{t} and make this behavior
the default.  Check also the variable
@code{org-fast-tag-selection-include-todo}, it allows to change the TODO
state through the tags interface (@pxref{Setting tags}).

@node Per-file keywords, Faces for TODO keywords, Fast access to TODO states, TODO extensions
@subsection Setting up keywords for individual files
@cindex keyword options
@cindex per-file keywords

It can be very useful to use different aspects of the TODO mechanism in
different files.  For file-local settings, you need to add special lines
to the file which set the keywords and interpretation for that file
only.  For example, to set one of the two examples discussed above, you
need one of the following lines, starting in column zero anywhere in the
file:

@example
#+SEQ_TODO: TODO FEEDBACK VERIFY | DONE CANCELED
@end example
or
@example
#+TYP_TODO: Fred Sara Lucy Mike | DONE
@end example

A setup for using several sets in parallel would be:

@example
#+SEQ_TODO: TODO | DONE
#+SEQ_TODO: REPORT BUG KNOWNCAUSE | FIXED
#+SEQ_TODO: | CANCELED
@end example

@cindex completion, of option keywords
@kindex M-@key{TAB}
@noindent To make sure you are using the correct keyword, type
@samp{#+} into the buffer and then use @kbd{M-@key{TAB}} completion.

@cindex DONE, final TODO keyword
Remember that the keywords after the vertical bar (or the last keyword
if no bar is there) must always mean that the item is DONE (although you
may use a different word).  After changing one of these lines, use
@kbd{C-c C-c} with the cursor still in the line to make the changes
known to Org-mode@footnote{Org-mode parses these lines only when
Org-mode is activated after visiting a file.  @kbd{C-c C-c} with the
cursor in a line starting with @samp{#+} is simply restarting Org-mode
for the current buffer.}.

@node Faces for TODO keywords,  , Per-file keywords, TODO extensions
@subsection Faces for TODO keywords
@cindex faces, for TODO keywords

Org-mode highlights TODO keywords with special faces: @code{org-todo}
for keywords indicating that an item still has to be acted upon, and
@code{org-done} for keywords indicating that an item is finished.  If
you are using more than 2 different states, you might want to use
special faces for some of them.  This can be done using the variable
@code{org-todo-keyword-faces}.  For example:

@lisp
(setq org-todo-keyword-faces
      '(("TODO"      . org-warning)
        ("DEFERRED"  . shadow)
        ("CANCELED"  . (:foreground "blue" :weight bold))))
@end lisp

@page
@node Progress logging, Priorities, TODO extensions, TODO items
@section Progress Logging

Org-mode can automatically record a time stamp and even a note when you
mark a TODO item as DONE, or even each time you change the state of
a TODO item.

@menu

* Tracking TODO state changes::  When did the status change?
@end menu

@node Closing items, Tracking TODO state changes, Progress logging, Progress logging
@subsection Closing items

If you want to keep track of @emph{when} a certain TODO item was
finished, turn on logging with@footnote{The corresponding in-buffer
setting is: @code{#+STARTUP: logdone}.  You may also set this for the
scope of a subtree by adding a @code{LOGGING} property with one or more
of the logging keywords in the value.}

@lisp
(setq org-log-done t)
@end lisp

@noindent
Then each time you turn a TODO entry into DONE using either @kbd{C-c
C-t} in the Org-mode buffer or @kbd{t} in the agenda buffer, a line
@samp{CLOSED: [timestamp]} will be inserted just after the headline.  If
you turn the entry back into a TODO item through further state cycling,
that line will be removed again.  In the timeline (@pxref{Timeline}) and
in the agenda (@pxref{Weekly/Daily agenda}), you can then use the
@kbd{l} key to display the TODO items closed on each day, giving you an
overview of what has been done on a day.  If you want to record a note
along with the timestamp, use@footnote{The corresponding in-buffer
setting is: @code{#+STARTUP: lognotedone}}

@lisp
(setq org-log-done '(done))
@end lisp

@node Tracking TODO state changes,  , Closing items, Progress logging
@subsection Tracking TODO state changes

When TODO keywords are used as workflow states (@pxref{Workflow
states}), you might want to keep track of when a state change occurred
and record a note about this change.  With the setting@footnote{The
corresponding in-buffer setting is: @code{#+STARTUP: lognotestate}.}

@lisp
(setq org-log-done '(state))
@end lisp

@noindent
each state change will prompt you for a note that will be attached to
the current headline.  If you press @kbd{C-c C-c} without typing
anything into the note buffer, only the time of the state change will be
noted.  Very likely you do not want this verbose tracking all the time,
so it is probably better to configure this behavior with in-buffer
options.  For example, if you are tracking purchases, put these into a
separate file that contains:

@example
#+SEQ_TODO: TODO(t) ORDERED(o) INVOICE(i) PAYED(p) | RECEIVED(r)
#+STARTUP: lognotestate
@end example

If you only need to take a note for some of the states, mark those
states with an additional @samp{@@}, like this:

@example
#+SEQ_TODO: TODO(t) ORDERED(o@@) INVOICE(i@@) PAYED(p) | RECEIVED(r)
#+STARTUP: lognotestate
@end example

@node Priorities, Breaking down tasks, Progress logging, TODO items
@section Priorities
@cindex priorities

If you use Org-mode extensively, you may end up enough TODO items that
it starts to make sense to prioritize them.  Prioritizing can be done by
placing a @emph{priority cookie} into the headline of a TODO item, like
this

@example
*** TODO [#A] Write letter to Sam Fortune
@end example

@noindent
By default, Org-mode supports three priorities: @samp{A}, @samp{B}, and
@samp{C}.  @samp{A} is the highest priority.  An entry without a cookie
is treated as priority @samp{B}.  Priorities make a difference only in
the agenda (@pxref{Weekly/Daily agenda}); outside the agenda, they have
no inherent meaning to Org-mode.

Priorities can be attached to any outline tree entries; they do not need
to be TODO items.

@table @kbd
@kindex @kbd{C-c ,}
@item @kbd{C-c ,}
Set the priority of the current headline.  The command prompts for a
priority character @samp{A}, @samp{B} or @samp{C}.  When you press
@key{SPC} instead, the priority cookie is removed from the headline.
The priorities can also be changed ``remotely'' from the timeline and
agenda buffer with the @kbd{,} command (@pxref{Agenda commands}).
@c
@kindex S-@key{up}
@kindex S-@key{down}
@item S-@key{up}
@itemx S-@key{down}
Increase/decrease priority of current headline@footnote{See also the
option @code{org-priority-start-cycle-with-default'}.}.  Note that these
keys are also used to modify time stamps (@pxref{Creating timestamps}).
Furthermore, these keys are also used by CUA-mode (@pxref{Conflicts}).
@end table

You can change the range of allowed priorities by setting the variables
@code{org-highest-priority}, @code{org-lowest-priority}, and
@code{org-default-priority}.  For an individual buffer, you may set
these values (highest, lowest, default) like this (please make sure that
the highest priority is earlier in the alphabet than the lowest
priority):

@example
#+PRIORITIES: A C B
@end example

@node Breaking down tasks, Checkboxes, Priorities, TODO items
@section Breaking tasks down into subtasks
@cindex tasks, breaking down

It is often advisable to break down large tasks into smaller, manageable
subtasks.  You can do this by creating an outline tree below a TODO
item, with detailed subtasks on the tree@footnote{To keep subtasks out
of the global TODO list, see the
@code{org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels}.}.  Another possibility is the use
of checkboxes to identify (a hierarchy of) a large number of subtasks
(@pxref{Checkboxes}).


@node Checkboxes,  , Breaking down tasks, TODO items
@section Checkboxes
@cindex checkboxes

Every item in a plain list (@pxref{Plain lists}) can be made into a
checkbox by starting it with the string @samp{[ ]}.  This feature is
similar to TODO items (@pxref{TODO items}), but is more lightweight.
Checkboxes are not included into the global TODO list, so they are often
great to split a task into a number of simple steps.  Or you can use
them in a shopping list.  To toggle a checkbox, use @kbd{C-c C-c}, or
use the mouse (thanks to Piotr Zielinski's @file{org-mouse.el}).

Here is an example of a checkbox list.

@example
* TODO Organize party [3/6]
  - call people [1/3]
    - [ ] Peter
    - [X] Sarah
    - [ ] Sam
  - [X] order food
  - [ ] think about what music to play
  - [X] talk to the neighbors
@end example

@cindex statistics, for checkboxes
@cindex checkbox statistics
The @samp{[3/6]} and @samp{[1/3]} in the first and second line are
cookies indicating how many checkboxes present in this entry have been
checked off, and the total number of checkboxes are present.  This can
give you an idea on how many checkboxes remain, even without opening a
folded entry.  The cookies can be placed into a headline or into (the
first line of) a plain list item. Each cookie covers all checkboxes
structurally below the headline/item on which the cookie appear.  You
have to insert the cookie yourself by typing either @samp{[/]} or
@samp{[%]}.  With @samp{[/]} you get an @samp{n out of m} result, as in
the examples above.  With @samp{[%]} you get information about the
percentage of checkboxes checked (in the above example, this would be
@samp{[50%]} and @samp{[33%]}, respectively).

@noindent The following commands work with checkboxes:

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c C-c
@item C-c C-c
Toggle checkbox at point.  With prefix argument, set it to @samp{[-]},
which is considered to be an intermediate state.
@kindex C-c C-x C-b
@item C-c C-x C-b
Toggle checkbox at point.
@itemize @minus
@item
If there is an active region, toggle the first checkbox in the region
and set all remaining boxes to the same status as the first.  If you
want to toggle all boxes in the region independently, use a prefix
argument.
@item
If the cursor is in a headline, toggle checkboxes in the region between
this headline and the next (so @emph{not} the entire subtree).
@item
If there is no active region, just toggle the checkbox at point.
@end itemize
@kindex M-S-@key{RET}
@item M-S-@key{RET}
Insert a new item with a checkbox.
This works only if the cursor is already in a plain list item
(@pxref{Plain lists}).
@kindex C-c #
@item C-c #
Update the checkbox statistics in the current outline entry.  When
called with a @kbd{C-u} prefix, update the entire file.  Checkbox
statistic cookies are updated automatically if you toggle checkboxes
with @kbd{C-c C-c} and make new ones with @kbd{M-S-@key{RET}}.  If you
delete boxes or add/change them by hand, use this command to get things
back into synch.  Or simply toggle any checkbox twice with @kbd{C-c C-c}.

An excellent way to implement labels and contexts for cross-correlating
information is to assign @i{tags} to headlines.  Org-mode has extensive
support for tags.

Every headline can contain a list of tags; they occur at the end of the
headline.  Tags are normal words containing letters, numbers, @samp{_},
and @samp{@@}.  Tags must be preceded and followed by a single colon,
e.g., @samp{:WORK:}.  Several tags can be specified, as in
@samp{:work:URGENT:}.

@cindex sublevels, inclusion into tags match

@i{Tags} make use of the hierarchical structure of outline trees.  If a
heading has a certain tag, all subheadings will inherit the tag as
well.  For example, in the list

@example
* Meeting with the French group      :work:
** Summary by Frank                  :boss:notes:
*** TODO Prepare slides for him      :action:
@end example

@noindent
the final heading will have the tags @samp{:work:}, @samp{:boss:},
@samp{:notes:}, and @samp{:action:} even though the final heading is not
explicitly marked with those tags.  When executing tag searches and
Org-mode finds that a certain headline matches the search criterion, it
will not check any sublevel headline, assuming that these also match and
that the list of matches could become very long because of that.  If you
do want the subevels be tested and listed as well, you may set the

@kindex M-@key{TAB}
Tags can simply be typed into the buffer at the end of a headline.
After a colon, @kbd{M-@key{TAB}} offers completion on tags.  There is
also a special command for inserting tags:

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c C-c
@item C-c C-c
@cindex completion, of tags
Enter new tags for the current headline.  Org-mode will either offer
completion or a special single-key interface for setting tags, see
below.  After pressing @key{RET}, the tags will be inserted and aligned
to @code{org-tags-column}.  When called with a @kbd{C-u} prefix, all
tags in the current buffer will be aligned to that column, just to make
things look nice.  TAGS are automatically realigned after promotion,
demotion, and TODO state changes (@pxref{TODO basics}).
@end table

Org will support tag insertion based on a @emph{list of tags}.  By
default this list is constructed dynamically, containing all tags
currently used in the buffer.  You may also globally specify a hard list
of tags with the variable @code{org-tag-alist}.  Finally you can set
the default tags for a given file with lines like

@example
#+TAGS: @@work @@home @@tennisclub
#+TAGS: laptop car pc sailboat
@end example

If you have globally defined your preferred set of tags using the
variable @code{org-tag-alist}, but would like to use a dynamic tag list
in a specific file, add an empty TAGS option line to that file:

@example
#+TAGS:
@end example

The default support method for entering tags is minibuffer completion.
However, Org-mode also implements a much better method: @emph{fast tag
selection}.  This method allows to select and deselect tags with a
single key per tag.  To function efficiently, you should assign unique
keys to most tags.  This can be done globally with

@lisp
(setq org-tag-alist '(("@@work" . ?w) ("@@home" . ?h) ("laptop" . ?l)))
@end lisp

@noindent or on a per-file basis with

@example
#+TAGS: @@work(w)  @@home(h)  @@tennisclub(t)  laptop(l)  pc(p)
@end example

@noindent
You can also group together tags that are mutually exclusive.  With
curly braces@footnote{In @code{org-mode-alist} use
@code{'(:startgroup)} and @code{'(:endgroup)}, respectively.  Several
groups are allowed.}

@example
#+TAGS: @{ @@work(w)  @@home(h)  @@tennisclub(t) @}  laptop(l)  pc(p)
@end example

@noindent you indicate that at most one of @samp{@@work}, @samp{@@home},
and @samp{@@tennisclub} should be selected.

@noindent Don't forget to press @kbd{C-c C-c} with the cursor in one of
these lines to activate any changes.

If at least one tag has a selection key, pressing @kbd{C-c C-c} will
automatically present you with a special interface, listing inherited
tags, the tags of the current headline, and a list of all legal tags
with corresponding keys@footnote{Keys will automatically be assigned to
tags which have no configured keys.}.  In this interface, you can use
the following keys:

@table @kbd
@item a-z...
Pressing keys assigned to tags will add or remove them from the list of
tags in the current line.  Selecting a tag in a group of mutually
exclusive tags will turn off any other tags from that group.
@kindex @key{TAB}
@item @key{TAB}
Enter a tag in the minibuffer, even if the tag is not in the predefined
list.  You will be able to complete on all tags present in the buffer.
@kindex @key{SPC}
@item @key{SPC}
Clear all tags for this line.
@kindex @key{RET}
@item @key{RET}
Accept the modified set.
@item C-g
Abort without installing changes.
@item q
If @kbd{q} is not assigned to a tag, it aborts like @kbd{C-g}.
@item !
Turn off groups of mutually exclusive tags.  Use this to (as an
exception) assign several tags from such a group.
@item C-c
Toggle auto-exit after the next change (see below).
If you are using expert mode, the first @kbd{C-c} will display the
selection window.
@end table

@noindent
This method lets you assign tags to a headline with very few keys.  With
the above setup, you could clear the current tags and set @samp{@@home},
@samp{laptop} and @samp{pc} tags with just the following keys: @kbd{C-c
C-c @key{SPC} h l p @key{RET}}.  Switching from @samp{@@home} to
@samp{@@work} would be done with @kbd{C-c C-c w @key{RET}} or
alternatively with @kbd{C-c C-c C-c w}.  Adding the non-predefined tag
@samp{Sarah} could be done with @kbd{C-c C-c @key{TAB} S a r a h
@key{RET} @key{RET}}.

If you find that most of the time, you need only a single keypress to
modify your list of tags, set the variable
@code{org-fast-tag-selection-single-key}.  Then you no longer have to
press @key{RET} to exit fast tag selection - it will immediately exit
after the first change.  If you then occasionally need more keys, press
@kbd{C-c} to turn off auto-exit for the current tag selection process
(in effect: start selection with @kbd{C-c C-c C-c} instead of @kbd{C-c
C-c}).  If you set the variable to the value @code{expert}, the special
window is not even shown for single-key tag selection, it comes up only
when you press an extra @kbd{C-c}.

@node Tag searches,  , Setting tags, Tags

Once a system of tags has been set up, it can be used to collect related
information into special lists.

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c \
@kindex C-c / T
@item C-c \
@itemx C-c / T
Create a sparse tree with all headlines matching a tags search.  With a
@kbd{C-u} prefix argument, ignore headlines that are not a TODO line.
@kindex C-c a m
@item C-c a m

@kindex C-c a M
@item C-c a M
Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files, but check
only TODO items and force checking subitems (see variable
@code{org-tags-match-list-sublevels}).
@end table

@cindex Boolean logic, for tag searches
A @i{tags} search string can use Boolean operators @samp{&} for AND and
@samp{|} for OR.  @samp{&} binds more strongly than @samp{|}.
Parenthesis are currently not implemented.  A tag may also be preceded
by @samp{-}, to select against it, and @samp{+} is syntactic sugar for
positive selection.  The AND operator @samp{&} is optional when @samp{+}
or @samp{-} is present.  Examples:

@table @samp
@item +work-boss
Select headlines tagged @samp{:work:}, but discard those also tagged
@samp{:boss:}.
@item work|laptop
Selects lines tagged @samp{:work:} or @samp{:laptop:}.
@item work|laptop&night
Like before, but require the @samp{:laptop:} lines to be tagged also
@samp{night}.
@end table

@cindex TODO keyword matching, with tags search
If you are using multi-state TODO keywords (@pxref{TODO extensions}), it
can be useful to also match on the TODO keyword.  This can be done by
adding a condition after a slash to a tags match.  The syntax is similar
to the tag matches, but should be applied with consideration: For
example, a positive selection on several TODO keywords can not
meaningfully be combined with boolean AND.  However, @emph{negative
selection} combined with AND can be meaningful.  To make sure that only
lines are checked that actually have any TODO keyword, use @kbd{C-c a
M}, or equivalently start the todo part after the slash with @samp{!}.
Examples:

@table @samp
@item work/WAITING
Select @samp{:work:}-tagged TODO lines with the specific TODO
keyword @samp{WAITING}.
@item work/!-WAITING-NEXT
Select @samp{:work:}-tagged TODO lines that are neither @samp{WAITING}
nor @samp{NEXT}
@item work/+WAITING|+NEXT
Select @samp{:work:}-tagged TODO lines that are either @samp{WAITING} or
@samp{NEXT}.
@end table

@cindex regular expressions, with tags search
Any element of the tag/todo match can be a regular expression - in this
case it must be enclosed in curly braces.  For example,
@samp{work+@{^boss.*@}} matches headlines that contain the tag
@samp{work} and any tag @i{starting} with @samp{boss}.

@cindex level, require for tags/property match
@cindex category, require for tags/property match
You can also require a headline to be of a certain level or category, by
writing instead of any TAG an expression like @samp{LEVEL=3} or
@samp{CATEGORY="work"}, respectively.  For example, a search
@samp{+LEVEL=3+boss/-DONE} lists all level three headlines that have the
tag @samp{boss} and are @emph{not} marked with the todo keyword DONE.

@cindex properties

Properties are a set of key-value pairs associated with an entry.  There
are two main applications for properties in Org-mode.  First, properties
are like tags, but with a value.  Second, you can use properties to
implement (very basic) database capabilities in an Org-mode buffer.  For
an example of the first application, imagine maintaining a file where
you document bugs and plan releases of a piece of software.  Instead of
using tags like @code{:release_1:}, @code{:release_2:}, one can use a
property, say @code{Release}, that in different subtrees has different
values, such as @code{1.0} or @code{2.0}.  For an example of the second
application of properties, imagine keeping track of one's music CD's,
where properties could be things such as the album artist, date of
release, number of tracks, and so on.

Properties can be conveiently edited and viewed in column view
(@pxref{Column view}).






are like tags, but with a value.  For example, in a file where you
document bugs and plan releases of a piece of software, instead of using
tags like @code{:release_1:}, @code{:release_2:}, it can be more
efficient to use a property @code{Release} with a value @code{1.0} or
@code{2.0}.  Second, you can use properties to implement (very basic)
database capabilities in an Org-mode buffer, for example to create a
list of Music CD's you own.  You can edit and view properties
conveniently in column view (@pxref{Column view}).

@cindex drawer, for properties

Properties are key-value pairs.  They need to be inserted into a special
drawer (@pxref{Drawers}) with the name @code{PROPERTIES}.  Each property
is specified on a single line, with the key (surrounded by colons)
first, and the value after it.  Here is an example:

@example
* CD collection
** Classic
*** Goldberg Variations
    :PROPERTIES:
    :Title:     Goldberg Variations
    :Composer:  J.S. Bach
    :Artist:    Glen Gould 
    :Publisher: Deutsche Grammphon
    :NDisks:    1
    :END:       
@end example

You may define the allowed values for a particular property @samp{Xyz}
by setting a property @samp{Xyz_ALL}.  This special property is
@emph{inherited}, so if you set it in a level 1 entry, it will apply to
the entire tree.  When allowed values are defined, setting the
corresponding property becomes easier and is less prone to typing
errors.  For the example with the CD collection, we can predefine
publishers and the number of disks in a box like this:

@example
* CD collection
  :PROPERTIES:
  :NDisks_ALL:  1 2 3 4
  :Publisher_ALL: "Deutsche Grammophon" Phillips EMI
  :END:
@end example

If you want to set properties that can be inherited by any entry in a
file, use a line like

@example
#+PROPERTY: NDisks_ALL 1 2 3 4
@end example

Property values set with the global variable
@code{org-global-properties} can be inherited by all entries in all
Org-mode files.

@noindent
The following commands help to work with properties:

@table @kbd
@kindex M-@key{TAB}
@item M-@key{TAB}
After an initial colon in a line, complete property keys.  All keys used
in the current file will be offered as possible completions.
@kindex C-c C-x p
@item C-c C-x p
Set a property.  This prompts for a property name and a value.  If
necessary, the property drawer is created as well.
@item M-x org-insert-property-drawer
Insert a property drawer into the current entry.  The drawer will be
inserted early in the entry, but after the lines with planning
information like deadlines.
@kindex C-c C-c
@item C-c C-c
With the cursor in a property drawer, this executes property commands.
@item C-c C-c s
Set a property in the current entry.  Both the property and the value
can be inserted using completion.
@kindex S-@key{right}
@kindex S-@key{left}
@item S-@key{left}/@key{right}
Switch property at point to the next/previous allowed value.
@item C-c C-c d
Remove a property from the current entry.
@item C-c C-c D
Globally remove a property, from all entries in the current file.
@item C-c C-c c
Compute the property at point, using the operator and scope from the
nearest column format definition.

Special properties provide alternative access method to Org-mode
features discussed in the previous chapters, like the TODO state or the
priority of an entry.  This interface exists so that you can include
these states into columns view (@pxref{Column view}), or to use them in
queries.  The following property names are special and should not be
used as keys in the properties drawer:

@example
TODO         @r{The TODO keyword of the entry.}
TAGS         @r{The tags defined directly in the headline.}
ALLTAGS      @r{All tags, including inherited ones.}
PRIORITY     @r{The priority of the entry, a string with a single letter.}

To create sparse trees and special lists with selection based on
properties, the same commands are used as for tag searches (@pxref{Tag
searches}), and the same logic applies.  For example, a search string

@example
+work-boss+PRIORITY="A"+Coffee="unlimited"+With=@{Sarah\|Denny@}
@end example

@noindent
finds entries tagged @samp{:work:} but not @samp{:boss:}, which
also have a priority value @samp{A}, a @samp{:Coffee:} property with the
value @samp{unlimited}, and a @samp{:With:} property that is matched by
the regular expression @samp{Sarah\|Denny}.

You can configure Org-mode to use property inheritance during a search,
see @ref{Property inheritance} for details.

There is also a special command for creating sparse trees based on a
single property:

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c / p
@item C-c / p
Create a sparse tree based on the value of a property.  This first
prompts for the name of a property, and then for a value.  A sparse tree
is created with all entries that define this property with the given
value.  If you enclose the value into curly braces, it is interpreted as
a regular expression and matched against the property values.
@end table

@node Property inheritance, Column view, Property searches, Properties and columns
@section Property Inheritance

The outline structure of Org-mode documents lends itself for an
inheritance model of properties: If the parent in a tree has a certain
property, the children can inherit this property.  Org-mode does not
turn this on by default, because it can slow down property searches
significantly and is often not needed.  However, if you find inheritance
useful, you can turn it on by setting the variable
@code{org-use-property-inheritance}.  It may be set to @code{t}, to make
all properties inherited from the parent, or to a list of properties
that should be inherited.

Org-mode has a few properties for which inheritance is hard-coded, at
least for the special applications for which they are used:

@table @code
@item COLUMNS
The column property defines the format of column view (@pxref{Column
view}).  It is inherited in the sense that the level where a
@code{COLUMNS} property is defined is used as the starting point for a
column view table, independently of the location in the subtree from
where columns view is turned on.
@item CATEGORY
For agenda view, a category set through a @code{CATEGORY} property
applies to the entire subtree.
@item ARCHIVE
For archiving, the @code{ARCHIVE} property may define the archive
location for the entire subtree (@pxref{Moving subtrees}).
@end table

@node Column view, Property API, Property inheritance, Properties and columns
@section Column View

A great way to view and edit properties in an outline tree is
@emph{column view}.  In column view, each outline item is turned into a
table row.  Columns in this table provide access to properties of the
entries.  Org-mode implements columns by overlaying a tabular structure
over the headline of each item.  While the headlines have been turned
into a table row, you can still change the visibility of the outline
tree.  For example, you get a compact table by switching to CONTENTS
view (@kbd{S-@key{TAB} S-@key{TAB}}, or simply @kbd{c} while column view
is active), but you can still open, read, and edit the entry below each
headline.  Or, you can switch to column view after executing a sparse
tree command and in this way get a table only for the selected items.
Column view also works in agenda buffers (@pxref{Agenda views}) where
queries have collected selected items, possibly from a number of files.

@node Scope of column definitions, Column attributes, Defining columns, Defining columns
@subsubsection Scope of column definitions

To define a column format for an entire file, use a line like

@example
#+COLUMNS: %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO
@end example

To specify a format that only applies to a specific tree, add a COLUMNS
property to the top node of that tree, for example
@example
** Top node for columns view
   :PROPERTIES:
   :COLUMNS: %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO
   :END:
@end example

If a @code{COLUMNS} property is present in an entry, it defines columns
for the entry itself, and for the entire subtree below it.  Since the
column definition is part of the hierarchical structure of the document,
you can define columns on level 1 that are general enough for all
sublevels, and more specific columns further down, when you edit a
deeper part of the tree.

@node Column attributes,  , Scope of column definitions, Defining columns
@subsubsection Column attributes
A column definition sets the attributes of a column.  The general
definition looks like this:

@example
 %[width]property[(title)][@{summary-type@}]
@end example

@noindent
Except for the percent sign and the property name, all items are
optional.  The individual parts have the following meaning:

@example
width           @r{An integer specifying the width of the column in characters.}
                @r{If omitted, the width will be determined automatically.}
property        @r{The property that should be edited in this column.}
(title)         @r{The header text for the column. If omitted, the}
                @r{property name is used.}
@{summary-type@}  @r{The summary type.  If specified, the column values for}
                @r{parent nodes are computed from the children.}
                @r{Supported summary types are:}
                @{+@}       @r{Sum numbers in this column.}
                @{+;%.1f@}  @r{Like @samp{+}, but format result with @samp{%.1f}.}
                @{$@}       @r{Currency, short for @samp{+;%.2f}.}
                @{:@}       @r{Sum times, HH:MM:SS, plain numbers are hours.}
                @{X@}       @r{Checkbox status, [X] if all children are [X].}
@end example

@noindent
Here is an example for a complete columns definition, along with allowed
values.

@example
:COLUMNS:  %20ITEM %9Approved(Approved?)@{X@} %Owner %11Status %10Time_Spent@{:@}
:Owner_ALL:    Tammy Mark Karl Lisa Don
:Status_ALL:   "In progress" "Not started yet" "Finished" ""
:Approved_ALL: "[ ]" "[X]"
@end example

The first column, @samp{%25ITEM}, means the first 25 characters of the
item itself, i.e. of the headline.  You probably always should start the
column definition with the ITEM specifier.  The other specifiers create
columns @samp{Owner} with a list of names as allowed values, for
@samp{Status} with four different possible values, and for a checkbox
field @samp{Approved}.  When no width is given after the @samp{%}
character, the column will be exactly as wide as it needs to be in order
to fully display all values.  The @samp{Approved} column does have a
modified title (@samp{Approved?}, with a question mark).  Summaries will
be created for the @samp{Time_Spent} column by adding time duration
expressions like HH:MM, and for the @samp{Approved} column, by providing
an @samp{[X]} status if all children have been checked.

a format.  When one is found, the column view table is established for
the entire tree, starting from the entry that contains the @code{COLUMNS}

@node Capturing Column View,  , Using column view, Column view
@subsection Capturing Column View

Since column view is just an overlay over a buffer, it cannot be
exported or printed directly.  If you want to capture a column view, use
the dynamic block (@pxref{Dynamic blocks}).  The frame of this block
looks like this:

@example
* The column view
#+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id "label"

#+END:
@end example

@noindent This dynamic block has the following parameters:

@table @code
@item :id
This is most important parameter.  Column view is a feature that is
often localized to a certain (sub)tree, and the capture block might be
in a different location in the file.  To identify the tree whose view to
capture, you can use 3 values:
@example
local     @r{use the tree in which the capture block is located}
global    @r{make a global view, including all headings in the file}
"label"   @r{call column view in the tree that has and @code{:ID:}}
          @r{property with the value @i{label}}
@end example
@item :hlines
When @code{t}, insert a hline after every line.  When a number N, insert
a hline before each headline with level @code{<= N}.
@item :vlines
When set to @code{t}, enforce column groups to get vertical lines.
@end table

@noindent
The following commands insert or update the dynamic block:

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c C-x r
@item C-c C-x r
Insert a dynamic block capturing a column view.  You will be prompted
for the scope or id of the view.
@kindex C-c C-c
@item C-c C-c
@kindex C-c C-x C-u
@itemx C-c C-x C-u
Update dynamical block at point.  The cursor needs to be in the
@code{#+BEGIN} line of the dynamic block.
@kindex C-u C-c C-x C-u

A time stamp is a specification of a date (possibly with time or a range
of times) in a special format, either @samp{<2003-09-16 Tue>} or
@samp{<2003-09-16 Tue 09:39>} or @samp{<2003-09-16 Tue
12:00-12:30>}@footnote{This is the standard ISO date/time format.  To
use an alternative format, see @ref{Custom time format}.}.  A time stamp
can appear anywhere in the headline or body of an org-tree entry.  Its
presence causes entries to be shown on specific dates in the agenda
(@pxref{Weekly/Daily agenda}).  We distinguish:

@table @var
@item Plain time stamp; Event; Appointment
@cindex timestamp
A simple time stamp just assigns a date/time to an item.  This is just
like writing down an appointment or event in a paper agenda.  In the
timeline and agenda displays, the headline of an entry associated with a
plain time stamp will be shown exactly on that date.

@example
* Meet Peter at the movies <2006-11-01 Wed 19:15>
* Discussion on climate change <2006-11-02 Thu 20:00-22:00>
@end example

@item Time stamp with repeater interval
@cindex timestamp, with repeater interval
A time stamp may contain a @emph{repeater interval}, indicating that it
applies not only on the given date, but again and again after a certain
interval of N days (d), weeks (w), months(m), or years(y).  The
following will show up in the agenda every Wednesday:

@example
* Pick up Sam at school <2007-05-16 Wed 12:30 +1w>
@end example

@item Diary-style sexp entries
For more complex date specifications, Org-mode supports using the
special sexp diary entries implemented in the Emacs calendar/diary
package.  For example

@example
* The nerd meeting on every 2nd Thursday of the month
  <%%(diary-float t 4 2)>
@end example

@item Time/Date range
@cindex timerange
@cindex date range
Two time stamps connected by @samp{--} denote a range.  The headline
will be shown on the first and last day of the range, and on any dates
that are displayed and fall in the range.  Here is an example:

@example
** Meeting in Amsterdam
   <2004-08-23 Mon>--<2004-08-26 Thu>
@end example

@item Inactive time stamp
@cindex timestamp, inactive
@cindex inactive timestamp
Just like a plain time stamp, but with square brackets instead of
angular ones.  These time stamps are inactive in the sense that they do
@emph{not} trigger an entry to show up in the agenda.

@example
* Gillian comes late for the fifth time [2006-11-01 Wed]
@end example

For Org-mode to recognize time stamps, they need to be in the specific
format.  All commands listed below produce time stamps in the correct
format.

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c .
@item C-c .
Prompt for a date and insert a corresponding time stamp.  When the
cursor is at a previously used time stamp, it is updated to NOW.  When
this command is used twice in succession, a time range is inserted.
@c
@kindex C-u C-c .
@item C-u C-c .
Like @kbd{C-c .}, but use the alternative format which contains date
and time.  The default time can be rounded to multiples of 5 minutes,
see the option @code{org-time-stamp-rounding-minutes}.
@c
@kindex C-c !
@item C-c !
Like @kbd{C-c .}, but insert an inactive time stamp that will not cause
an agenda entry.
@c
@kindex C-c <
@item C-c <
Insert a time stamp corresponding to the cursor date in the Calendar.
@c
@kindex C-c >
@item C-c >
Access the Emacs calendar for the current date.  If there is a
timestamp in the current line, goto the corresponding date
instead.
@c
@kindex C-c C-o
@item C-c C-o
Access the agenda for the date given by the time stamp or -range at
point (@pxref{Weekly/Daily agenda}).
@c
@kindex S-@key{left}
@kindex S-@key{right}
@item S-@key{left}
@itemx S-@key{right}
Change date at cursor by one day.  These key bindings conflict with
CUA-mode (@pxref{Conflicts}).
@c
@kindex S-@key{up}
@kindex S-@key{down}
@item S-@key{up}
@itemx S-@key{down}
Change the item under the cursor in a timestamp.  The cursor can be on a
year, month, day, hour or minute.  Note that if the cursor is in a
headline and not at a time stamp, these same keys modify the priority of
an item.  (@pxref{Priorities}). The key bindings also conflict with
CUA-mode (@pxref{Conflicts}).
@c
@kindex C-c C-y
@cindex evaluate time range
@item C-c C-y
Evaluate a time range by computing the difference between start and
end.  With prefix arg, insert result after the time range (in a table:
into the following column).

@subsection The date/time prompt
@cindex date, reading in minibuffer
@cindex time, reading in minibuffer

When Org-mode prompts for a date/time, the default is shown as an ISO
date, and the prompt therefore seems to ask for an ISO date.  But it
will in fact accept any string containing some date and/or time
information, and it is really smart about interpreting your input.  You
can, for example, use @kbd{C-y} to paste a (possibly multi-line) string
copied from an email message.  Org-mode will find whatever information
is in there and derive anything you have not specified from the
@emph{default date and time}.  The default is usually the current date
and time, but when modifying an existing time stamp, or when entering
the second stamp of a range, it is taken from the stamp in the buffer.
When filling in information, Org-mode assumes that most of the time you
will want to enter a date in the future: If you omit the month/year and
the given day/month is @i{before} today, it will assume that you mean a
future date@footnote{See the variable
@code{org-read-date-prefer-future}.}.

For example, lets assume that today is @b{June 13, 2006}.  Here is how
various inputs will be interpreted, the items filled in by Org-mode are
in @b{bold}.

@example
3-2-5         --> 2003-02-05
14            --> @b{2006}-@b{06}-14
12            --> @b{2006}-@b{07}-12
Fri           --> nearest Friday (defaultdate or later)
sep 15        --> @b{2006}-11-15
feb 15        --> @b{2007}-02-15
sep 12 9      --> 2009-09-12
12:45         --> @b{2006}-@b{06}-@b{13} 12:45
22 sept 0:34  --> @b{2006}-09-22 0:34
@end example

Furthermore you can specify a relative date by giving, as the
@emph{first} thing in the input: a plus/minus sign, a number and a
letter [dwmy] to indicate change in days weeks, months, years.  With a
single plus or minus, the date is always relative to today.  With a
double plus or minus, it is relative to the default date.  If instead of
a single letter, you use the abbreviation of day name, the date will be
the nth such day.  E.g.

@example
+4d           --> four days from today
+4            --> same as above
+2w           --> two weeks from today
++5           --> five days from default date
+2tue         --> second tuesday from now.
@end example

The function understands English month and weekday abbreviations.  If
you want to use unabbreviated names and/or other languages, configure
the variables @code{parse-time-months} and @code{parse-time-weekdays}.

@cindex calendar, for selecting date
Parallel to the minibuffer prompt, a calendar is popped up@footnote{If
you don't need/want the calendar, configure the variable
@code{org-popup-calendar-for-date-prompt}.}.  When you exit the date
prompt, either by clicking on a date in the calendar, or by pressing
@key{RET}, the date selected in the calendar will be combined with the
information entered at the prompt.  You can control the calendar fully
from the minibuffer:

@kindex <
@kindex >
@kindex mouse-1
@kindex S-@key{right}
@kindex S-@key{left}
@kindex S-@key{down}
@kindex S-@key{up}
@kindex M-S-@key{right}
@kindex M-S-@key{left}
@kindex @key{RET}
@example
> / <          @r{Scroll calendar forward/backward by one month.}
mouse-1        @r{Select date by clicking on it.}
S-@key{right}/@key{left}     @r{One day forward/backward.}
S-@key{down}/@key{up}     @r{One week forward/backward.}
M-S-@key{right}/@key{left}   @r{One month forward/backward.}
@key{RET}           @r{Choose date in calendar.}
@end example

The actions of the date/time prompt may seem complex, but I asure you
they will grow on you.  To help you understand what is going on, the
current interpretation of your input will be displayed live in the
minibuffer@footnote{If you find this distracting, turn the display of
with @code{org-read-date-display-live}.}.

Org-mode uses the standard ISO notation for dates and times as it is
defined in ISO 8601.  If you cannot get used to this and require another
representation of date and time to keep you happy, you can get it by
customizing the variables @code{org-display-custom-times} and
@code{org-time-stamp-custom-formats}.

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c C-x C-t
@item C-c C-x C-t
Toggle the display of custom formats for dates and times.
@end table

@noindent
Org-mode needs the default format for scanning, so the custom date/time
format does not @emph{replace} the default format - instead it is put
@emph{over} the default format using text properties.  This has the
following consequences:
@itemize @bullet
@item 
You cannot place the cursor onto a time stamp anymore, only before or
after.
@item
The @kbd{S-@key{up}/@key{down}} keys can no longer be used to adjust
each component of a time stamp.  If the cursor is at the beginning of
the stamp, @kbd{S-@key{up}/@key{down}} will change the stamp by one day,
just like @kbd{S-@key{left}/@key{right}}.  At the end of the stamp, the
time will be changed by one minute.
@item
If the time stamp contains a range of clock times or a repeater, these
will not be overlayed, but remain in the buffer as they were.
@item
When you delete a time stamp character-by-character, it will only
disappear from the buffer after @emph{all} (invisible) characters
belonging to the ISO timestamp have been removed.
@item
If the custom time stamp format is longer than the default and you are
using dates in tables, table alignment will be messed up.  If the custom
format is shorter, things do work as expected.
@end itemize


@node Deadlines and scheduling, Clocking work time, Creating timestamps, Dates and times
@section Deadlines and Scheduling

A time stamp may be preceded by special keywords to facilitate planning:

@table @var
@item DEADLINE
@cindex DEADLINE keyword

Meaning: the task (most likely a TODO item, though not necessarily) is supposed
to be finished on that date.

On the deadline date, the task will be listed in the agenda.  In
addition, the agenda for @emph{today} will carry a warning about the
approaching or missed deadline, starting
@code{org-deadline-warning-days} before the due date, and continuing
until the entry is marked DONE.  An example:

@example
*** TODO write article about the Earth for the Guide
    The editor in charge is [[bbdb:Ford Prefect]]
    DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun>
@end example

You can specify a different lead time for warnings for a specific
deadlines using the following syntax.  Here is an example with a warning
period of 5 days @code{DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun -5d>}.

@item SCHEDULED
@cindex SCHEDULED keyword

Meaning: you are planning to start working on that task on the given
date.

The headline will be listed under the given date@footnote{It will still
be listed on that date after it has been marked DONE.  If you don't like
this, set the variable @code{org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done}.}.  In
addition, a reminder that the scheduled date has passed will be present
in the compilation for @emph{today}, until the entry is marked DONE.
I.e., the task will automatically be forwarded until completed.

@example
*** TODO Call Trillian for a date on New Years Eve.
    SCHEDULED: <2004-12-25 Sat>
@end example

@noindent
@b{Important:} Scheduling an item in Org-mode should @i{not} be
understood in the same way that we understand @i{scheduling a meeting}.
Setting a date for a meeting is just a simple appointment, you should
mark this entry with a simple plain time stamp, to get this item shown
on the date where it applies.  This is a frequent mis-understanding from
Org-users.  In Org-mode, @i{scheduling} means setting a date when you
want to start working on an action item.

prefix, check that many days.  For example, @kbd{C-1 C-c / d} shows

@item C-c C-s
Insert @samp{SCHEDULED} keyword along with a stamp.  The insertion will
happen in the line directly following the headline.  Any CLOSED
timestamp will be removed.  When called with a prefix argument, remove
the scheduling date from the entry.
@end table

@node Repeated tasks,  , Inserting deadline/schedule, Deadlines and scheduling
@subsection Repeated Tasks

Some tasks need to be repeated again and again.  Org-mode helps to
organize such tasks using a so-called repeater in a DEADLINE or
SCHEDULED time stamp.  In the following example
@example
** TODO Pay the rent
   DEADLINE: <2005-10-01 Sat +1m>
@end example
the @code{+1m} is a repeater; the intended interpretation is that the
task has a deadline on <2005-10-01> and repeats itself every (one) month
starting from that time.

Deadlines and scheduled items produce entries in the agenda when they
are over-due, so it is important to be able to mark such an entry as
completed once you have done so.  When you mark a DEADLINE or a SCHEDULE
with the todo keyword DONE, it will no longer produce entries in the
agenda. The problem with this is, however, that then also the
@emph{next} instance of the repeated entry will not be active.  Org-mode
deals with this in the following way: When you try to mark such an entry
DONE (using @kbd{C-c C-t}), it will shift the base date of the repeating
time stamp by the repeater interval, and immediately set the entry state
back to TODO.  In the example above, setting the state to DONE would
actually switch the date like this:

@example
** TODO Pay the rent
   DEADLINE: <2005-11-01 Tue +1m>
@end example

You will also be prompted for a note@footnote{You can change this using
the option @code{org-log-repeat}, or the @code{#+STARTUP} options
@code{logrepeat} and @code{nologrepeat}.} that will be put under the
DEADLINE line to keep a record that you actually acted on the previous
instance of this deadline.

As a consequence of shifting the base date, this entry will no longer be
visible in the agenda when checking past dates, but all future instances
will be visible.

You may have both scheduling and deadline information for a specific
task - just make sure that the repeater intervals on both are the same.

@node Clocking work time,  , Deadlines and scheduling, Dates and times
@section Clocking work time

Org-mode allows you to clock the time you spent on specific tasks in a
project.  When you start working on an item, you can start the clock.
When you stop working on that task, or when you mark the task done, the
clock is stopped and the corresponding time interval is recorded.  It
also computes the total time spent on each subtree of a project.

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c C-x C-i
@item C-c C-x C-i
Start the clock on the current item (clock-in).  This inserts the CLOCK
keyword together with a timestamp.  If this is not the first clocking of
this item, the multiple CLOCK lines will be wrapped into a
@code{:CLOCK:} drawer (see also the variable
@code{org-clock-into-drawer}.
@kindex C-c C-x C-o
@item C-c C-x C-o
Stop the clock (clock-out).  The inserts another timestamp at the same
location where the clock was last started.  It also directly computes
the resulting time in inserts it after the time range as @samp{=>
HH:MM}.  See the variable @code{org-log-done} for the possibility to
record an additional note together with the clock-out time
stamp@footnote{The corresponding in-buffer setting is: @code{#+STARTUP:
lognoteclock-out}}.
@kindex C-c C-y
@item C-c C-y
Recompute the time interval after changing one of the time stamps.  This
is only necessary if you edit the time stamps directly.  If you change
them with @kbd{S-@key{cursor}} keys, the update is automatic.
@kindex C-c C-t
@item C-c C-t
Changing the TODO state of an item to DONE automatically stops the clock
if it is running in this same item.
@kindex C-c C-x C-x
@item C-c C-x C-x
Cancel the current clock.  This is useful if a clock was started by
mistake, or if you ended up working on something else.
@kindex C-c C-x C-j
@item C-c C-x C-j
Jump to the entry that contains the currently running clock, an another
window.
@kindex C-c C-x C-d
@item C-c C-x C-d
Display time summaries for each subtree in the current buffer.  This
puts overlays at the end of each headline, showing the total time
recorded under that heading, including the time of any subheadings. You
can use visibility cycling to study the tree, but the overlays disappear
when you change the buffer (see variable
@code{org-remove-highlights-with-change}) or press @kbd{C-c C-c}.
@kindex C-c C-x C-r
@item C-c C-x C-r
Insert a dynamic block (@pxref{Dynamic blocks}) containing a clock
report as an org-mode table into the current file.  When the cursor is
at an existing clock table, just update it.  When called with a prefix
argument, jump to the first clock report in the current document and
update it.
@example
#+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :emphasize nil :scope file

#+END: clocktable
@end example
@noindent
If such a block already exists at point, its content is replaced by the
new table.  The @samp{BEGIN} line can specify options:
@example
:maxlevel    @r{Maximum level depth to which times are listed in the table.}
:emphasize   @r{When @code{t}, emphasize level one and level two items}
:scope       @r{The scope to consider.  This can be any of the following:}
             nil        @r{the current buffer or narrowed region}
             file       @r{the full current buffer}
             subtree    @r{the subtree where the clocktable is located}
             treeN      @r{the surrounding level N tree, for example @code{tree3}}
             tree       @r{the surrounding level 1 tree}
             agenda     @r{all agenda files}
             ("file"..) @r{scan these files}
:block       @r{The time block to consider.  This block is specified relative}
             @r{to the current time and may be any of these keywords:}
             @r{@code{today}, @code{yesterday}, @code{thisweek}, @code{lastweek},}
             @r{@code{thismonth}, @code{lastmonth}, @code{thisyear}, or @code{lastyear}}.
:tstart      @r{A time string specifying when to start considering times}
:tend        @r{A time string specifying when to stop considering times}
@end example
So to get a clock summary of the current level 1 tree, for the current
day, you could write
@example
#+BEGIN: clocktable :maxlevel 2 :block today :scope tree1

#+END: clocktable
@end example
and to use a specific time range you could write@footnote{Note that all
parameters must be specified in a single line - the line is broken here
only to fit it onto the manual.}
@example
#+BEGIN: clocktable :tstart "<2006-08-10 Thu 10:00>" 
                    :tend "<2006-08-10 Thu 12:00>"

#+END: clocktable
@end example
@kindex C-c C-c
@item C-c C-c
@kindex C-c C-x C-u
@itemx C-c C-x C-u
Update dynamical block at point.  The cursor needs to be in the
@code{#+BEGIN} line of the dynamic block.
@kindex C-u C-c C-x C-u
@item C-u C-c C-x C-u
Update all dynamic blocks (@pxref{Dynamic blocks}).  This is useful if
you have several clocktable blocks in a buffer.

@cindex @file{remember.el}

The @i{Remember} package by John Wiegley lets you store quick notes with
little interruption of your work flow.  See
@uref{http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/RememberMode} for more
information.  It is an excellent way to add new notes and tasks to
Org-mode files.  Org-mode significantly expands the possibilities of
@i{remember}: You may define templates for different note types, and
associate target files and headlines with specific templates.  It also
allows you to select the location where a note should be stored
interactively, on the fly.

@menu
* Setting up remember::         Some code for .emacs to get things going
* Remember templates::          Define the outline of different note types
* Storing notes::               Directly get the note to where it belongs
* Refiling notes::              Moving a note or task to a project
@end menu

@node Setting up remember, Remember templates, Remember, Remember
@section Setting up remember

The following customization will tell @i{remember} to use org files as
target, and to create annotations compatible with Org-mode links.

@example
(org-remember-insinuate)
(setq org-directory "~/path/to/my/orgfiles/")
(setq org-default-notes-file (concat org-directory "/notes.org"))
(define-key global-map "\C-cr" 'org-remember)
@end example

The last line binds the command @code{org-remember} to a global
key@footnote{Please select your own key, @kbd{C-c r} is only a
suggestion.}.  @code{org-remember} basically just calls @code{remember},
but it makes a few things easier: If there is an active region, it will
automatically copy the region into the remember buffer.  It also allows
to jump to the buffer and location where remember notes are being
stored: Just call @code{org-remember} with a prefix argument.

@node Remember templates, Storing notes, Setting up remember, Remember
@section Remember templates
@cindex templates, for remember

In combination with Org-mode, you can use templates to generate
different types of @i{remember} notes.  For example, if you would like
to use one template to create general TODO entries, another one for
journal entries, and a third one for collecting random ideas, you could
use:

@example
(setq org-remember-templates
 '(("Todo" ?t "* TODO %?\n  %i\n  %a" "~/org/TODO.org" "Tasks")
   ("Journal" ?j "* %U %?\n\n  %i\n  %a" "~/org/JOURNAL.org")
   ("Idea" ?i "* %^@{Title@}\n  %i\n  %a" "~/org/JOURNAL.org" "New Ideas")))
@end example

@noindent In these entries, the first string is just a name, and the
character specifies how to select the template.  It is useful if the
character is also the first letter of the name.  The next string
specifies the template.  Two more (optional) strings give the file in
which, and the headline under which the new note should be stored.  The
file (if not present or @code{nil}) defaults to
@code{org-default-notes-file}, the heading to
@code{org-remember-default-headline}.

When you call @kbd{M-x remember} (or @kbd{M-x org-remember}) to remember
something, org will prompt for a key to select the template (if you have
more than one template) and then prepare the buffer like
@example
* TODO
  [[file:link to where you called remember]]
@end example

@noindent
During expansion of the template, special @kbd{%}-escapes allow dynamic
insertion of content:
@example
%^@{prompt@}  @r{prompt the user for a string and replace this sequence with it.}
            @r{You may specify a default value and a completion table with}
            @r{%^@{prompt|default|completion2|completion3...@}}
            @r{The arrow keys access a prompt-specific history.}
%t          @r{time stamp, date only}

If you change you mind about which template to use, call
@code{org-remember} in the remember buffer.  You may then select a new
template that will be filled with the previous context information.

@node Storing notes, Refiling notes, Remember templates, Remember
@section Storing notes

When you are finished preparing a note with @i{remember}, you have to
press @kbd{C-c C-c} to file the note away.  The handler will store the
note in the file and under the headline specified in the template, or it
will use the default file and headlines.  The window configuration will
be restored, sending you back to the working context before the call to
@code{remember}.  To re-use the location found during the last call to
@code{remember}, exit the remember buffer with @kbd{C-u C-u C-c C-c},
i.e. specify a double prefix argument to @kbd{C-c C-c}.

If you want to store the note directly to a different place, use
@kbd{C-u C-c C-c} instead to exit remember@footnote{Configure the
variable @code{org-remember-store-without-prompt} to make this behavior
the default.}.  The handler will then first prompt for a target file -
if you press @key{RET}, the value specified for the template is used.
Then the command offers the headings tree of the selected file, with the
cursor position at the default headline (if you had specified one in the
template).  You can either immediately press @key{RET} to get the note
placed there.  Or you can use the following keys to find a different
location:
@example
@key{TAB}         @r{Cycle visibility.}
@key{down} / @key{up}   @r{Next/previous visible headline.}
n / p        @r{Next/previous visible headline.}
f / b        @r{Next/previous headline same level.}
u            @r{One level up.}
@c 0-9          @r{Digit argument.}
@end example
@noindent
Pressing @key{RET} or @key{left} or @key{right}
then leads to the following result.

@multitable @columnfractions 0.2 0.15 0.65
@item @b{Cursor position} @tab @b{Key} @tab @b{Note gets inserted}
@item on headline     @tab @key{RET}              @tab as sublevel of the heading at cursor, first or last
@item                 @tab                        @tab depending on @code{org-reverse-note-order}.
@item                 @tab @key{left}/@key{right} @tab as same level, before/after current heading

@item not on headline @tab @key{RET}
      @tab at cursor position, level taken from context.
@end multitable

Before inserting the text into a tree, the function ensures that the
text has a headline, i.e. a first line that starts with a @samp{*}.  If
not, a headline is constructed from the current date and some additional
data.  If you have indented the text of the note below the headline, the
indentation will be adapted if inserting the note into the tree requires
demotion from level 1.

@node Refiling notes,  , Storing notes, Remember
@section Refiling notes
@cindex refiling notes

Remember is usually used to quickly capture notes and tasks into one or
a few capture lists.  When reviewing the captured data, you may want to
refile some of the entries into a different list, for example into a
project.  Cutting, finding the right location and then pasting the note
is cumbersome.  To simplify this process, you can use the following
special command:

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c C-w
@item C-c C-w
Refile the entry at point.  This command offers possible locations for
refiling the entry and lets you select one with completion.  The item is
filed below the target heading as a subitem.  Depending on
@code{org-reverse-note-order}, it will be either the first of last
subitem, and you can toggle the value of this variable for the duration
of the command by using a @kbd{C-u} prefix.@* By default, all level 1
headlines in the current buffer are considered to be targets, but you
can have more complex definitions across a number of files.  See the
variable @code{org-refile-targets} for details.  The list of targets is
compiled upon first use, you can update it by using a double prefix
argument (@kbd{C-u C-u}) to this command.

@node Agenda views, Embedded LaTeX, Remember, Top
@chapter Agenda Views
@cindex agenda views

Due to the way Org-mode works, TODO items, time-stamped items, and
tagged headlines can be scattered throughout a file or even a number of
files.  To get an overview of open action items, or of events that are
important for a particular date, this information must be collected,
sorted and displayed in an organized way.

Org-mode can select items based on various criteria, and display them
in a separate buffer.  Six different view types are provided:

@itemize @bullet
@item
an @emph{agenda} that is like a calendar and shows information
for specific dates,
@item
a @emph{TODO list} that covers all unfinished
action items,
@item
a @emph{tags view}, showings headlines based on
the tags associated with them,
@item
a @emph{timeline view} that shows all events in a single Org-mode file,
in time-sorted view,
@item
a @emph{stuck projects view} showing projects that currently don't move
along, and
@item
@emph{custom views} that are special tag/keyword searches and
combinations of different views.
@end itemize

@noindent
The extracted information is displayed in a special @emph{agenda
buffer}.  This buffer is read-only, but provides commands to visit the
corresponding locations in the original Org-mode files, and even to
edit these files remotely.  

Two variables control how the agenda buffer is displayed and whether the
window configuration is restored when the agenda exits:
@code{org-agenda-window-setup} and
@code{org-agenda-restore-windows-after-quit}.

@cindex files for agenda

The information to be shown is normally collected from all @emph{agenda
files}, the files listed in the variable
@code{org-agenda-files}@footnote{If the value of that variable is not a
list, but a single file name, then the list of agenda files will be
maintained in that external file.}. If a directory is part of this list,
all files with the extension @file{.org} in this directory will be part
of the list.

Thus even if you only work with a single Org-mode file, this file should
be put into that list@footnote{When using the dispatcher, pressing
@kbd{<} before selecting a command will actually limit the command to
the current file, and ignore @code{org-agenda-files} until the next
dispatcher command.}.  You can customize @code{org-agenda-files}, but
the easiest way to maintain it is through the following commands

@cindex files, adding to agenda list
@table @kbd
@kindex C-c [
@item C-c [
Add current file to the list of agenda files.  The file is added to
the front of the list.  If it was already in the list, it is moved to
the front.  With prefix arg, file is added/moved to the end.
@kindex C-c ]
@item C-c ]
Remove current file from the list of agenda files.
@kindex C-,
@kindex C-'
@item C-,
@itemx C-'
Cycle through agenda file list, visiting one file after the other.
@end table

@noindent
The Org menu contains the current list of files and can be used
to visit any of them.

If you would like to focus the agenda temporarily onto a file not in
this list, or onto just one file in the list or even only a subtree in a
file, this can be done in different ways.  For a single agenda command,
you may press @kbd{<} once or several times in the dispatcher
(@pxref{Agenda dispatcher}).  To restrict the agenda scope for an
extended period, use the following commands:

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c C-x <
@item C-c C-x <
Permanently restrict the agenda to the current subtree.  When with a
prefix argument, or with the cursor before the first headline in a file,
the agenda scope is set to the entire file.  This restriction remains in
effect until removed with @kbd{C-c C-x >}, or by typing either @kbd{<}
or @kbd{>} in the agenda dispatcher.  If there is a window displaying an
agenda view, the new restriction takes effect immediately.
@kindex C-c C-x <
@item C-c C-x <
Remove the permanent restriction created by @kbd{C-c C-x <}.
@end table

@noindent
When working with @file{Speedbar}, you can use the following commands in
the speedbar frame:
@table @kbd
@kindex <
@item < @r{in the speedbar frame}
Permanently restrict the agenda to the item at the cursor in the
speedbar frame, either an Org-mode file or a subtree in such a file.
If there is a window displaying an agenda view, the new restriction takes
effect immediately.
@kindex <
@item > @r{in the speedbar frame}
Lift the restriction again.

@cindex dispatching agenda commands
The views are created through a dispatcher that should be bound to a
global key, for example @kbd{C-c a} (@pxref{Installation}).  In the
following we will assume that @kbd{C-c a} is indeed how the dispatcher
is accessed and list keyboard access to commands accordingly.  After
pressing @kbd{C-c a}, an additional letter is required to execute a
command.  The dispatcher offers the following default commands:
@table @kbd
@item a
Create the calendar-like agenda (@pxref{Weekly/Daily agenda}).
@item t @r{/} T
Create a list of all TODO items (@pxref{Global TODO list}).
@item m @r{/} M
Create a list of headlines matching a TAGS expression (@pxref{Matching
tags and properties}).
@item L
Create the timeline view for the current buffer (@pxref{Timeline}).
@item # @r{/} !
Create a list of stuck projects (@pxref{Stuck projects}).
@item /
Search for a regular expression in all agenda files and additionally in
the files listed in @code{org-agenda-multi-occur-extra-files}.  This
uses the Emacs command @code{multi-occur}.  A prefix argument can be
used to specify the number of context lines for each match, default is
1.
@item <
Restrict an agenda command to the current buffer@footnote{For backward
compatibility, you can also press @kbd{1} to restrict to the current
buffer.}.  After pressing @kbd{<}, you still need to press the character
selecting the command.
@item < <
If there is an active region, restrict the following agenda command to
the region.  Otherwise, restrict it to the current subtree@footnote{For
backward compatibility, you can also press @kbd{0} to restrict to the
current buffer.}.  After pressing @kbd{< <}, you still need to press the
character selecting the command.
@end table

You can also define custom commands that will be accessible through the
dispatcher, just like the default commands.  This includes the
possibility to create extended agenda buffers that contain several
blocks together, for example the weekly agenda, the global TODO list and
a number of special tags matches.  @xref{Custom agenda views}.

The purpose of the weekly/daily @emph{agenda} is to act like a page of a
paper agenda, showing all the tasks for the current week or day.

@table @kbd
@cindex org-agenda, command
@kindex C-c a a
@item C-c a a
Compile an agenda for the current week from a list of org files.  The
agenda shows the entries for each day.  With a numeric
prefix@footnote{For backward compatibility, the universal prefix
@kbd{C-u} causes all TODO entries to be listed before the agenda.  This
feature is deprecated, use the dedicated TODO list, or a block agenda
instead.}  (like @kbd{C-u 2 1 C-c a a}) you may set the number of days
to be displayed (see also the variable @code{org-agenda-ndays})
@end table

Remote editing from the agenda buffer means, for example, that you can
change the dates of deadlines and appointments from the agenda buffer.
The commands available in the Agenda buffer are listed in @ref{Agenda
commands}.

@subsubheading Calendar/Diary integration
@cindex calendar integration
@cindex diary integration

Emacs contains the calendar and diary by Edward M. Reingold.  The
calendar displays a three-month calendar with holidays from different
countries and cultures.  The diary allows you to keep track of
anniversaries, lunar phases, sunrise/set, recurrent appointments
(weekly, monthly) and more.  In this way, it is quite complementary to
Org-mode.  It can be very useful to combine output from Org-mode with
the diary.

In order to include entries from the Emacs diary into Org-mode's
agenda, you only need to customize the variable

@lisp
(setq org-agenda-include-diary t)
@end lisp

@noindent After that, everything will happen automatically.  All diary
entries including holidays, anniversaries etc will be included in the
agenda buffer created by Org-mode.  @key{SPC}, @key{TAB}, and
@key{RET} can be used from the agenda buffer to jump to the diary
file in order to edit existing diary entries.  The @kbd{i} command to
insert new entries for the current date works in the agenda buffer, as
well as the commands @kbd{S}, @kbd{M}, and @kbd{C} to display
Sunrise/Sunset times, show lunar phases and to convert to other
calendars, respectively.  @kbd{c} can be used to switch back and forth
between calendar and agenda.

If you are using the diary only for sexp entries and holidays, it is
faster to not use the above setting, but instead to copy or even move
the entries into an Org-mode file. Org-mode evaluates diary-style sexp
entries, and does it faster because there is no overhead for first
creating the diary display.  Note that the sexp entries must start at
the left margin, no white space is allowed before them.  For example,
the following segment of an Org-mode file will be processed and entries
will be made in the agenda:

@example
* Birthdays and similar stuff
#+CATEGORY: Holiday
%%(org-calendar-holiday)   ; special function for holiday names
#+CATEGORY: Ann
%%(diary-anniversary 14  5 1956) Arthur Dent is %d years old
%%(diary-anniversary  2 10 1869) Mahatma Gandhi would be %d years old
@end example

@subsubheading Appointment reminders
@cindex @file{appt.el}
@cindex appointment reminders

Org can interact with Emacs appointments notification facility.

To add all the appointments of your agenda files, use the command
@code{org-agenda-to-appt}.  This commands also lets you filter through
the list of your appointments and add only those belonging to a specific
category or matching a regular expression. See the docstring for
details.

@node Global TODO list, Matching tags and properties, Weekly/Daily agenda, Built-in agenda views
@subsection The global TODO list
@cindex global TODO list
@cindex TODO list, global

The global TODO list contains all unfinished TODO items, formatted and
collected into a single place.

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c a t
@item C-c a t
Show the global TODO list.  This collects the TODO items from all
agenda files (@pxref{Agenda views}) into a single buffer.  The buffer is in
@code{agenda-mode}, so there are commands to examine and manipulate
the TODO entries directly from that buffer (@pxref{Agenda commands}).
@kindex C-c a T
@item C-c a T
@cindex TODO keyword matching
Like the above, but allows selection of a specific TODO keyword.  You
can also do this by specifying a prefix argument to @kbd{C-c a t}.  With
a @kbd{C-u} prefix you are prompted for a keyword, and you may also
specify several keywords by separating them with @samp{|} as boolean OR
operator.  With a numeric prefix, the Nth keyword in
@code{org-todo-keywords} is selected.
@kindex r
The @kbd{r} key in the agenda buffer regenerates it, and you can give
a prefix argument to this command to change the selected TODO keyword,
for example @kbd{3 r}.  If you often need a search for a specific
keyword, define a custom command for it (@pxref{Agenda dispatcher}).@*
Matching specific TODO keywords can also be done as part of a tags
search (@pxref{Tag searches}).
@end table

Remote editing of TODO items means that you can change the state of a
TODO entry with a single key press.  The commands available in the
TODO list are described in @ref{Agenda commands}.

@cindex sublevels, inclusion into todo list
Normally the global todo list simply shows all headlines with TODO
keywords.  This list can become very long.  There are two ways to keep
it more compact:
@itemize @minus
@item
Some people view a TODO item that has been @emph{scheduled} for
execution (@pxref{Time stamps}) as no longer @emph{open}.  Configure the
variable @code{org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled} to exclude scheduled
items from the global TODO list.
@item
TODO items may have sublevels to break up the task into subtasks.  In
such cases it may be enough to list only the highest level TODO headline
and omit the sublevels from the global list.  Configure the variable
@code{org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels} to get this behavior.
@end itemize

to them and collect them into an agenda buffer.

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c a m
@item C-c a m
Produce a list of all headlines that match a given set of tags.  The
command prompts for a selection criterion, which is a boolean logic
expression with tags, like @samp{+work+urgent-withboss} or
@samp{work|home} (@pxref{Tags}).  If you often need a specific search,
define a custom command for it (@pxref{Agenda dispatcher}).
@kindex C-c a M
@item C-c a M
Like @kbd{C-c a m}, but only select headlines that are also TODO items
and force checking subitems (see variable
@code{org-tags-match-list-sublevels}).  Matching specific todo keywords
together with a tags match is also possible, see @ref{Tag searches}.

to give an overview over events in a project.

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c a L
@item C-c a L
Show a time-sorted view of the org file, with all time-stamped items.
When called with a @kbd{C-u} prefix, all unfinished TODO entries
(scheduled or not) are also listed under the current date.
@end table

@noindent
The commands available in the timeline buffer are listed in
@ref{Agenda commands}.


@node Stuck projects,  , Timeline, Built-in agenda views
@subsection Stuck projects

If you are following a system like David Allen's GTD to organize your
work, one of the ``duties'' you have is a regular review to make sure
that all projects move along.  A @emph{stuck} project is a project that
has no defined next actions, so it will never show up in the TODO lists
Org-mode produces.  During the review, you need to identify such
projects and define next actions for them.

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c a #
@item C-c a #
List projects that are stuck.
@kindex C-c a !
@item C-c a !
Customize the variable @code{org-stuck-projects} to define what a stuck
project is and how to find it.
@end table

You almost certainly will have to configure this view before it will
work for you.  The built-in default assumes that all your projects are
level-2 headlines, and that a project is not stuck if it has at least
one entry marked with a todo keyword TODO or NEXT or NEXTACTION.

Lets assume that you, in your own way of using Org-mode, identify
projects with a tag PROJECT, and that you use a todo keyword MAYBE to
indicate a project that should not be considered yet.  Lets further
assume that the todo keyword DONE marks finished projects, and that NEXT
and TODO indicate next actions.  The tag @@SHOP indicates shopping and
is a next action even without the NEXT tag.  Finally, if the project
contains the special word IGNORE anywhere, it should not be listed
either.  In this case you would start by identifying eligible projects
with a tags/todo match @samp{+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE}, and then check for
TODO, NEXT, @@SHOP, and IGNORE in the subtree to identify projects that
are not stuck.  The correct customization for this is

@lisp
(setq org-stuck-projects
      '("+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE" ("NEXT" "TODO") ("@@SHOP")
                               "\\<IGNORE\\>"))
@end lisp


@node Presentation and sorting, Agenda commands, Built-in agenda views, Agenda views
@section Presentation and sorting
@cindex presentation, of agenda items

Before displaying items in an agenda view, Org-mode visually prepares
the items and sorts them.  Each item occupies a single line.  The line
starts with a @emph{prefix} that contains the @emph{category}
(@pxref{Categories}) of the item and other important information.  You can
customize the prefix using the option @code{org-agenda-prefix-format}.
The prefix is followed by a cleaned-up version of the outline headline
associated with the item.

@menu
* Categories::                  Not all tasks are equal
* Time-of-day specifications::  How the agenda knows the time
* Sorting of agenda items::     The order of things
@end menu

@node Categories, Time-of-day specifications, Presentation and sorting, Presentation and sorting
@subsection Categories

@cindex category
The category is a broad label assigned to each agenda item.  By default,
the category is simply derived from the file name, but you can also
specify it with a special line in the buffer, like this@footnote{For
backward compatibility, the following also works: If there are several
such lines in a file, each specifies the category for the text below it.
The first category also applies to any text before the first CATEGORY
line.  However, using this method is @emph{strongly} deprecated as it is
incompatible with the outline structure of the document.  The correct
method for setting multiple categories in a buffer is using a
property.}:

@example
#+CATEGORY: Thesis
@end example

@noindent
If you would like to have a special CATEGORY for a single entry or a
(sub)tree, give the entry a @code{:CATEGORY:} property with the location
as the value (@pxref{Properties and columns}).

@noindent
The display in the agenda buffer looks best if the category is not
longer than 10 characters.

@node Time-of-day specifications, Sorting of agenda items, Categories, Presentation and sorting
@subsection Time-of-Day Specifications
@cindex time-of-day specification

Org-mode checks each agenda item for a time-of-day specification.  The
time can be part of the time stamp that triggered inclusion into the
agenda, for example as in @w{@samp{<2005-05-10 Tue 19:00>}}.  Time
ranges can be specified with two time stamps, like
@c
@w{@samp{<2005-05-10 Tue 20:30>--<2005-05-10 Tue 22:15>}}.

In the headline of the entry itself, a time(range) may also appear as
plain text (like @samp{12:45} or a @samp{8:30-1pm}.  If the agenda
integrates the Emacs diary (@pxref{Weekly/Daily agenda}), time
specifications in diary entries are recognized as well.

For agenda display, Org-mode extracts the time and displays it in a
standard 24 hour format as part of the prefix.  The example times in
the previous paragraphs would end up in the agenda like this:

@example
    8:30-13:00 Arthur Dent lies in front of the bulldozer
   12:45...... Ford Prefect arrives and takes Arthur to the pub
   19:00...... The Vogon reads his poem
   20:30-22:15 Marwin escorts the Hitchhikers to the bridge
@end example

@cindex time grid
If the agenda is in single-day mode, or for the display of today, the
timed entries are embedded in a time grid, like

@subsection Sorting of agenda items
@cindex sorting, of agenda items
@cindex priorities, of agenda items
Before being inserted into a view, the items are sorted.  How this is
done depends on the type of view.
@itemize @bullet
@item
For the daily/weekly agenda, the items for each day are sorted.  The
default order is to first collect all items containing an explicit
time-of-day specification.  These entries will be shown at the beginning
of the list, as a @emph{schedule} for the day.  After that, items remain
grouped in categories, in the sequence given by @code{org-agenda-files}.
Within each category, items are sorted by priority (@pxref{Priorities}),
which is composed of the base priority (2000 for priority @samp{A}, 1000
for @samp{B}, and 0 for @samp{C}), plus additional increments for
overdue scheduled or deadline items.
@item 
For the TODO list, items remain in the order of categories, but within
each category, sorting takes place according to priority
(@pxref{Priorities}).
@item
For tags matches, items are not sorted at all, but just appear in the
sequence in which they are found in the agenda files.
@end itemize

Sorting can be customized using the variable
@code{org-agenda-sorting-strategy}.

@section Commands in the agenda buffer
@cindex commands, in agenda buffer

Entries in the agenda buffer are linked back to the org file or diary
file where they originate.  You are not allowed to edit the agenda
buffer itself, but commands are provided to show and jump to the
original entry location, and to edit the org-files ``remotely'' from
the agenda buffer.  In this way, all information is stored only once,
removing the risk that your agenda and note files may diverge.

Some commands can be executed with mouse clicks on agenda lines.  For
the other commands, the cursor needs to be in the desired line.

Custom agenda commands serve two purposes: to store and quickly access
frequently used TODO and tags searches, and to create special composite
agenda buffers.  Custom agenda commands will be accessible through the
dispatcher (@pxref{Agenda dispatcher}), just like the default commands.

@menu
* Storing searches::            Type once, use often
* Block agenda::                All the stuff you need in a single buffer

* Exporting Agenda Views::      Writing agendas to files.
* Extracting Agenda Information for other programs::  
@end menu

@node Storing searches, Block agenda, Custom agenda views, Custom agenda views
@subsection Storing searches

The first application of custom searches is the definition of keyboard
shortcuts for frequently used searches, either creating an agenda
buffer, or a sparse tree (the latter covering of course only the current
buffer).
@kindex C-c a C
Custom commands are configured in the variable
@code{org-agenda-custom-commands}.  You can customize this variable, for
example by pressing @kbd{C-c a C}.  You can also directly set it with
Emacs Lisp in @file{.emacs}.  The following example contains all valid
search types:

@lisp
@group
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("w" todo "WAITING")
        ("W" todo-tree "WAITING")
        ("u" tags "+BOSS-URGENT")
        ("v" tags-todo "+BOSS-URGENT")
        ("U" tags-tree "+BOSS-URGENT")
        ("f" occur-tree "\\<FIXME\\>")
        ("h" . "HOME+Name tags searches") ; description for "h" prefix
        ("hl" tags "+HOME+Lisa")
        ("hp" tags "+HOME+Peter")
        ("hk" tags "+HOME+Kim")))
@end group
@end lisp

@noindent
The initial string in each entry defines the keys you have to press
after the dispatcher command @kbd{C-c a} in order to access the command.
Usually this will be just a single character, but if you have many
similar commands, you can also define two-letter combinations where the
first character is the same in several combinations and serves as a
prefix key@footnote{You can provide a description for a prefix key by
inserting a cons cell with the prefix and the description.}.  The second
parameter is the search type, followed by the string or regular
expression to be used for the matching.  The example above will
therefore define:

@table @kbd
@item C-c a w
as a global search for TODO entries with @samp{WAITING} as the TODO
keyword
@item C-c a W
as the same search, but only in the current buffer and displaying the
results as a sparse tree
@item C-c a u
as a global tags search for headlines marked @samp{:BOSS:} but not
@samp{:URGENT:}
@item C-c a v
as the same search as @kbd{C-c a u}, but limiting the search to
headlines that are also TODO items
@item C-c a U
as the same search as @kbd{C-c a u}, but only in the current buffer and
displaying the result as a sparse tree
@item C-c a f
to create a sparse tree (again: current buffer only) with all entries
containing the word @samp{FIXME}
@item C-c a h
as a prefix command for a HOME tags search where you have to press an
additional key (@kbd{l}, @kbd{p} or @kbd{k}) to select a name (Lisa,
Peter, or Kim) as additional tag to match.
@end table

@node Block agenda, Setting Options, Storing searches, Custom agenda views
@subsection Block agenda
@cindex block agenda
@cindex agenda, with block views

Another possibility is the construction of agenda views that comprise
the results of @emph{several} commands, each of which creates a block in
the agenda buffer.  The available commands include @code{agenda} for the
daily or weekly agenda (as created with @kbd{C-c a a}), @code{alltodo}
for the global todo list (as constructed with @kbd{C-c a t}), and the
matching commands discussed above: @code{todo}, @code{tags}, and
@code{tags-todo}.  Here are two examples:

@lisp
@group
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
         ((agenda)
          (tags-todo "HOME")
          (tags "GARDEN")))
        ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
         ((agenda)
          (tags-todo "WORK")
          (tags "OFFICE")))))
@end group
@end lisp

@noindent
This will define @kbd{C-c a h} to create a multi-block view for stuff
you need to attend to at home.  The resulting agenda buffer will contain
your agenda for the current week, all TODO items that carry the tag
@samp{HOME}, and also all lines tagged with @samp{GARDEN}.  Finally the
command @kbd{C-c a o} provides a similar view for office tasks.


@node Setting Options, Exporting Agenda Views, Block agenda, Custom agenda views
@subsection Setting Options for custom commands
@cindex options, for custom agenda views

Org-mode contains a number of variables regulating agenda construction
and display.  The global variables define the behavior for all agenda
commands, including the custom commands.  However, if you want to change
some settings just for a single custom view, you can do so.  Setting
options requires inserting a list of variable names and values at the
right spot in @code{org-agenda-custom-commands}.  For example:

@lisp
@group
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("w" todo "WAITING"
         ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-down))
          (org-agenda-prefix-format "  Mixed: ")))
        ("U" tags-tree "+BOSS-URGENT"
         ((org-show-following-heading nil)
          (org-show-hierarchy-above nil)))))
@end group
@end lisp

@noindent
Now the @kbd{C-c a w} command will sort the collected entries only by
priority, and the prefix format is modified to just say @samp{  Mixed:}
instead of giving the category of the entry.  The sparse tags tree of
@kbd{C-c a U} will now turn out ultra-compact, because neither the
headline hierarchy above the match, nor the headline following the match
will be shown.

For command sets creating a block agenda,
@code{org-agenda-custom-commands} has two separate spots for setting
options.  You can add options that should be valid for just a single
command in the set, and options that should be valid for all commands in
the set.  The former are just added to the command entry, the latter
must come after the list of command entries.  Going back to the block
agenda example (@pxref{Block agenda}), let's change the sorting strategy
for the @kbd{C-c a h} commands to @code{priority-down}, but let's sort
the results for GARDEN tags query in the opposite order,
@code{priority-up}.  This would look like this:

@lisp
@group
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
         ((agenda)
          (tags-todo "HOME")
          (tags "GARDEN"
                ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-up)))))
         ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-down))))
        ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
         ((agenda)
          (tags-todo "WORK")
          (tags "OFFICE")))))
@end group
@end lisp

As you see, the values and parenthesis setting is a little complex.
When in doubt, use the customize interface to set this variable - it
fully supports its structure.  Just one caveat: When setting options in
this interface, the @emph{values} are just lisp expressions.  So if the
value is a string, you need to add the double quotes around the value
yourself.


@node Exporting Agenda Views, Extracting Agenda Information for other programs, Setting Options, Custom agenda views
@subsection Exporting Agenda Views
@cindex agenda views, exporting

If you are away from your computer, it can be very useful to have a
printed version of some agenda views to carry around.  Org-mode can
export custom agenda views as plain text, HTML@footnote{You need to
install Hrvoje Niksic' @file{htmlize.el}.} and postscript.  If you want
to do this only occasionally, use the command

@table @kbd
@kindex C-x C-w
@item C-x C-w
@cindex exporting agenda views
@cindex agenda views, exporting
Write the agenda view to a file.  Depending on the extension of the
selected file name, the view will be exported as HTML (extension
@file{.html} or @file{.htm}), Postscript (extension @file{.ps}), or
plain text (any other extension).  Use the variable
@code{org-agenda-exporter-settings} to set options for @file{ps-print}
and for @file{htmlize} to be used during export, for example
@lisp
(setq org-agenda-exporter-settings
      '((ps-number-of-columns 2)
        (ps-landscape-mode t)
        (htmlize-output-type 'css)))
@end lisp
@end table

If you need to export certain agenda views frequently, you can associate
any custom agenda command with a list of output file names
@footnote{If you want to store standard views like the weekly agenda
or the global TODO list as well, you need to define custom commands for
them in order to be able to specify filenames.}.  Here is an example
that first does define custom commands for the agenda and the global
todo list, together with a number of files to which to export them.
Then we define two block agenda commands and specify filenames for them
as well.  File names can be relative to the current working directory,
or absolute.

@lisp
@group
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("X" agenda "" nil ("agenda.html" "agenda.ps"))
        ("Y" alltodo "" nil ("todo.html" "todo.txt" "todo.ps"))
        ("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
         ((agenda)
          (tags-todo "HOME")
          (tags "GARDEN"))
         nil
         ("~/views/home.html"))
        ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
         ((agenda)
          (tags-todo "WORK")
          (tags "OFFICE"))
         nil
         ("~/views/office.ps"))))
@end group
@end lisp

The extension of the file name determines the type of export.  If it is
@file{.html}, Org-mode will use the @file{htmlize.el} package to convert
the buffer to HTML and save it to this file name.  If the extension is
@file{.ps}, @code{ps-print-buffer-with-faces} is used to produce
postscript output.  Any other extension produces a plain ASCII file.

The export files are @emph{not} created when you use one of those
commands interactively.  Instead, there is a special command to produce
@emph{all} specified files in one step:

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c a e
@item C-c a e
Export all agenda views that have export filenames associated with
them.
@end table

You can use the options section of the custom agenda commands to also
set options for the export commands.  For example:

@lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("X" agenda ""
         ((ps-number-of-columns 2)
          (ps-landscape-mode t)
          (org-agenda-prefix-format " [ ] ")
          (org-agenda-with-colors nil)
          (org-agenda-remove-tags t))
         ("theagenda.ps"))))
@end lisp

@noindent
This command sets two options for the postscript exporter, to make it
print in two columns in landscape format - the resulting page can be cut
in two and then used in a paper agenda.  The remaining settings modify
the agenda prefix to omit category and scheduling information, and
instead include a checkbox to check off items.  We also remove the tags
to make the lines compact, and we don't want to use colors for the
black-and-white printer.  Settings specified in
@code{org-agenda-exporter-settings} will also apply, but the settings
in @code{org-agenda-custom-commands} take precedence.

@noindent
From the command line you may also use
@example
emacs -f org-batch-store-agenda-views -kill
@end example
@noindent
or, if you need to modify some parameters
@example
emacs -eval '(org-batch-store-agenda-views                      \
              org-agenda-ndays 30                               \
              org-agenda-start-day "2007-11-01"                 \
              org-agenda-include-diary nil                      \
              org-agenda-files (quote ("~/org/project.org")))'  \
      -kill
@end example
@noindent
which will create the agenda views restricted to the file
@file{~/org/project.org}, without diary entries and with 30 days
extent. 

@node Extracting Agenda Information for other programs,  , Exporting Agenda Views, Custom agenda views
@subsection Extracting Agenda Information for other programs
@cindex agenda, pipe
@cindex Scripts, for agenda processing

Org-mode provides commands to access agenda information for the command
line in emacs batch mode.  This extracted information can be sent
directly to a printer, or it can be read by a program that does further
processing of the data.  The first of these commands is the function
@code{org-batch-agenda}, that produces an agenda view and sends it as
ASCII text to STDOUT.  The command takes a single string as parameter.
If the string has length 1, it is used as a key to one of the commands
you have configured in @code{org-agenda-custom-commands}, basically any
key you can use after @kbd{C-c a}.  For example, to directly print the
current TODO list, you could use

@example
emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-batch-agenda "t")' | lpr
@end example

If the parameter is a string with 2 or more characters, it is used as a
tags/todo match string.  For example, to print your local shopping list
(all items with the tag @samp{shop}, but excluding the tag
@samp{NewYork}), you could use

@example
emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs                                      \       
      -eval '(org-batch-agenda "+shop-NewYork")' | lpr
@end example

@noindent
You may also modify parameters on the fly like this:

@example
emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs                                      \
   -eval '(org-batch-agenda "a"                               \
            org-agenda-ndays 30                               \
            org-agenda-include-diary nil                      \
            org-agenda-files (quote ("~/org/project.org")))'  \
   | lpr
@end example

@noindent
which will produce a 30 day agenda, fully restricted to the Org file
@file{~/org/projects.org}, not even including the diary.

If you want to process the agenda data in more sophisticated ways, you
can use the command @code{org-batch-agenda-csv} to get a comma-separated
list of values for each agenda item.  Each line in the output will
contain a number of fields separated by commas.  The fields in a line
are:

@example
category     @r{The category of the item}
head         @r{The headline, without TODO kwd, TAGS and PRIORITY}
type         @r{The type of the agenda entry, can be}
                todo               @r{selected in TODO match}
                tagsmatch          @r{selected in tags match}
                diary              @r{imported from diary}
                deadline           @r{a deadline}
                scheduled          @r{scheduled}
                timestamp          @r{appointment, selected by timestamp}
                closed             @r{entry was closed on date}
                upcoming-deadline  @r{warning about nearing deadline}
                past-scheduled     @r{forwarded scheduled item}
                block              @r{entry has date block including date}
todo         @r{The todo keyword, if any}
tags         @r{All tags including inherited ones, separated by colons}
date         @r{The relevant date, like 2007-2-14}
time         @r{The time, like 15:00-16:50}
extra        @r{String with extra planning info}
priority-l   @r{The priority letter if any was given}
priority-n   @r{The computed numerical priority}
@end example

@noindent
Time and date will only be given if a timestamp (or deadline/scheduled)
lead to the selection of the item.

A CSV list like this is very easy to use in a post processing script.
For example, here is a Perl program that gets the TODO list from
Emacs/org-mode and prints all the items, preceded by a checkbox:

@example
@group
#!/usr/bin/perl

# define the Emacs command to run
$cmd = "emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-batch-agenda-csv \"t\")'";

# run it and capture the output
$agenda = qx@{$cmd 2>/dev/null@};

# loop over all lines
foreach $line (split(/\n/,$agenda)) @{

  # get the individual values
  ($category,$head,$type,$todo,$tags,$date,$time,$extra,
   $priority_l,$priority_n) = split(/,/,$line);

  # proccess and print
  print "[ ] $head\n";
@}
@end group

@cindex @TeX{} interpretation
@cindex La@TeX{} interpretation

Plain ASCII is normally sufficient for almost all note taking.  One
exception, however, are scientific notes which need to be able to
contain mathematical symbols and the occasional formula.
La@TeX{}@footnote{La@TeX{} is a macro system based on Donald E. Knuth's
@TeX{} system.  Many of the features described here as ``La@TeX{}'' are
really from @TeX{}, but for simplicity I am blurring this distinction.}
is widely used to typeset scientific documents. Org-mode supports
embedding La@TeX{} code into its files, because many academics are used
to read La@TeX{} source code, and because it can be readily processed
into images for HTML production.

It is not necessary to mark La@TeX{} macros and code in any special way.
If you observe a few conventions, Org-mode knows how to find it and what
to do with it.

@menu

* Subscripts and Superscripts::  Simple syntax for raising/lowering text
* LaTeX fragments::             Complex formulas made easy
* Processing LaTeX fragments::  Previewing LaTeX processing
* CDLaTeX mode::                Speed up entering of formulas
@end menu

@node Math symbols, Subscripts and Superscripts, Embedded LaTeX, Embedded LaTeX
@section Math symbols
@cindex math symbols
@cindex TeX macros

You can use La@TeX{} macros to insert special symbols like @samp{\alpha}
to indicate the Greek letter, or @samp{\to} to indicate an arrow.
Completion for these macros is available, just type @samp{\} and maybe a
few letters, and press @kbd{M-@key{TAB}} to see possible completions.
Unlike La@TeX{} code, Org-mode allows these macros to be present
without surrounding math delimiters, for example:

@example
Angles are written as Greek letters \alpha, \beta and \gamma.
@end example

During HTML export (@pxref{HTML export}), these symbols are translated
into the proper syntax for HTML, for the above examples this is
@samp{&alpha;} and @samp{&rarr;}, respectively.

@node Subscripts and Superscripts, LaTeX fragments, Math symbols, Embedded LaTeX
@section Subscripts and Superscripts
@cindex subscript
@cindex superscript

Just like in La@TeX{}, @samp{^} and @samp{_} are used to indicate super-
and subscripts.  Again, these can be used without embedding them in
math-mode delimiters.  To increase the readability of ASCII text, it is
not necessary (but OK) to surround multi-character sub- and superscripts
with curly braces.  For example

@example
The mass if the sun is M_sun = 1.989 x 10^30 kg.  The radius of
the sun is R_@{sun@} = 6.96 x 10^8 m.
@end example

To avoid interpretation as raised or lowered text, you can quote
@samp{^} and @samp{_} with a backslash: @samp{\_} and @samp{\^}.

During HTML export (@pxref{HTML export}), subscript and superscripts
are surrounded with @code{<sub>} and @code{<sup>} tags, respectively.

@node LaTeX fragments, Processing LaTeX fragments, Subscripts and Superscripts, Embedded LaTeX
@section LaTeX fragments
@cindex LaTeX fragments

With symbols, sub- and superscripts, HTML is pretty much at its end when
it comes to representing mathematical formulas@footnote{Yes, there is
MathML, but that is not yet fully supported by many browsers, and there
is no decent converter for turning La@TeX{} or ASCII representations of
formulas into MathML. So for the time being, converting formulas into
images seems the way to go.}. More complex expressions need a dedicated
formula processor. To this end, Org-mode can contain arbitrary La@TeX{}
fragments. It provides commands to preview the typeset result of these
fragments, and upon export to HTML, all fragments will be converted to
images and inlined into the HTML document@footnote{The La@TeX{} export
will not use images for displaying La@TeX{} fragments but include these
fragments directly into the La@TeX{} code.}. For this to work you
need to be on a system with a working La@TeX{} installation. You also
need the @file{dvipng} program, available at
@url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvipng/}. The La@TeX{} header that
will be used when processing a fragment can be configured with the
variable @code{org-format-latex-header}.

La@TeX{} fragments don't need any special marking at all.  The following
snippets will be identified as La@TeX{} source code:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Environments of any kind.  The only requirement is that the
@code{\begin} statement appears on a new line, preceded by only
whitespace.
@item
Text within the usual La@TeX{} math delimiters.  To avoid conflicts with
currency specifications, single @samp{$} characters are only recognized
as math delimiters if the enclosed text contains at most two line breaks,
is directly attached to the @samp{$} characters with no whitespace in
between, and if the closing @samp{$} is followed by whitespace or
punctuation.  For the other delimiters, there is no such restriction, so
when in doubt, use @samp{\(...\)} as inline math delimiters.
@end itemize

@noindent For example:

@example
\begin@{equation@}                          % arbitrary environments,
x=\sqrt@{b@}                                % even tables, figures
\end@{equation@}                            % etc

If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be
either $$ a=+\sqrt@{2@} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt@{2@} \].
@end example

@noindent
If you need any of the delimiter ASCII sequences for other purposes, you
can configure the option @code{org-format-latex-options} to deselect the
ones you do not wish to have interpreted by the La@TeX{} converter.

@node Processing LaTeX fragments, CDLaTeX mode, LaTeX fragments, Embedded LaTeX
@section Processing LaTeX fragments

La@TeX{} fragments can be processed to produce a preview images of the
typeset expressions:

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c C-x C-l
@item C-c C-x C-l
Produce a preview image of the La@TeX{} fragment at point and overlay it

two prefix arguments, or when the cursor is before the first headline,
process the entire buffer.
@kindex C-c C-c

@node CDLaTeX mode,  , Processing LaTeX fragments, Embedded LaTeX
@section Using CDLaTeX to enter math
@cindex CDLaTeX

CDLaTeX-mode is a minor mode that is normally used in combination with a
major La@TeX{} mode like AUCTeX in order to speed-up insertion of
environments and math templates.  Inside Org-mode, you can make use of
some of the features of cdlatex-mode.  You need to install
@file{cdlatex.el} and @file{texmathp.el} (the latter comes also with
AUCTeX) from @url{http://www.astro.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools/cdlatex}.
Don't turn cdlatex-mode itself under Org-mode, but use the light
version @code{org-cdlatex-mode} that comes as part of Org-mode.  Turn it
on for the current buffer with @code{M-x org-cdlatex-mode}, or for all
Org-mode files with

@lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-org-cdlatex)
@end lisp

When this mode is enabled, the following features are present (for more
details see the documentation of cdlatex-mode):
@itemize @bullet
@kindex C-c @{
@item
Environment templates can be inserted with @kbd{C-c @{}.
@item
@kindex @key{TAB}
The @key{TAB} key will do template expansion if the cursor is inside a
La@TeX{} fragment@footnote{Org-mode has a method to test if the cursor is
inside such a fragment, see the documentation of the function
@code{org-inside-LaTeX-fragment-p}.}.  For example, @key{TAB} will
expand @code{fr} to @code{\frac@{@}@{@}} and position the cursor
correctly inside the first brace.  Another @key{TAB} will get you into
the second brace.  Even outside fragments, @key{TAB} will expand
environment abbreviations at the beginning of a line.  For example, if
you write @samp{equ} at the beginning of a line and press @key{TAB},
this abbreviation will be expanded to an @code{equation} environment.
To get a list of all abbreviations, type @kbd{M-x cdlatex-command-help}.
@item
@kindex _
@kindex ^
Pressing @kbd{_} and @kbd{^} inside a La@TeX{} fragment will insert these
characters together with a pair of braces.  If you use @key{TAB} to move
out of the braces, and if the braces surround only a single character or
macro, they are removed again (depending on the variable
@code{cdlatex-simplify-sub-super-scripts}).
@item
@kindex `
Pressing the backquote @kbd{`} followed by a character inserts math
macros, also outside La@TeX{} fragments.  If you wait more than 1.5 seconds
after the backquote, a help window will pop up.
@item
@kindex '
Pressing the normal quote @kbd{'} followed by another character modifies
the symbol before point with an accent or a font.  If you wait more than
1.5 seconds after the backquote, a help window will pop up.  Character
modification will work only inside La@TeX{} fragments, outside the quote
is normal.

Org-mode documents can be exported into a variety of other formats.  For
printing and sharing of notes, ASCII export produces a readable and
simple version of an Org-mode file.  HTML export allows you to publish a
notes file on the web, while the XOXO format provides a solid base for
exchange with a broad range of other applications. La@TeX{} export lets
you use Org-mode and its structured editing functions to easily create
La@TeX{} files.  To incorporate entries with associated times like
deadlines or appointments into a desktop calendar program like iCal,
Org-mode can also produce extracts in the iCalendar format.  Currently
Org-mode only supports export, not import of these different formats.

When exporting, Org-mode uses special conventions to enrich the output
produced.  @xref{Text interpretation}, for more details.

@node Images, CSS support, Links, HTML export
@subsection Images

@cindex images, inline in HTML
@cindex inlining images in HTML
HTML export can inline images given as links in the Org-mode file, and
it can make an image the clickable part of a link.  By
default@footnote{but see the variable
@code{org-export-html-inline-images}}, images are inlined if a link does
not have a description.  So @samp{[[file:myimg.jpg]]} will be inlined,
while @samp{[[file:myimg.jpg][the image]]} will just produce a link
@samp{the image} that points to the image.  If the description part
itself is a @code{file:} link or a @code{http:} URL pointing to an
image, this image will be inlined and activated so that clicking on the
image will activate the link.  For example, to include a thumbnail that
will link to a high resolution version of the image, you could use:

@example
[[file:highres.jpg][file:thumb.jpg]]
@end example

@noindent
and you could use @code{http} addresses just as well.

@node CSS support,  , Images, HTML export
@subsection CSS support

You can also give style information for the exported file.  The HTML
exporter assigns the following CSS classes to appropriate parts of the
document - your style specifications may change these:
@example
.todo           @r{TODO keywords}
.done           @r{the DONE keyword}
.timestamp      @r{time stamp}
.timestamp-kwd  @r{keyword associated with a time stamp, like SCHEDULED}
.tag            @r{tag in a headline}
.target         @r{target for links}
@end example

The default style specification can be configured through the option
@code{org-export-html-style}.  If you want to use a file-local style,
you may use file variables, best wrapped into a COMMENT section at the
end of the outline tree.  For example@footnote{Under Emacs 21, the
continuation lines for a variable value should have no @samp{#} at the
start of the line.}:

@example
* COMMENT html style specifications

# Local Variables:
# org-export-html-style: "   <style type=\"text/css\">
#       p @{font-weight: normal; color: gray; @}
#       h1 @{color: black; @}
#   </style>"
# End:
@end example

Remember to execute @kbd{M-x normal-mode} after changing this to make
the new style visible to Emacs.  This command restarts org-mode for the
current buffer and forces Emacs to re-evaluate the local variables
section in the buffer.

@subsection Text before the first headline

Org-mode normally ignores any text before the first headline when
exporting, leaving this region for internal links to speed up navigation
etc.  However, in publishing-oriented files, you might want to have some
text before the first headline, like a small introduction, special HTML
code with a navigation bar, etc.  You can ask to have this part of the
file exported as well by setting the variable
@code{org-export-skip-text-before-1st-heading} to @code{nil}.  On a
per-file basis, you can get the same effect with

@example
#+OPTIONS: skip:nil
@end example

The text before the first headline will be fully processed
(@pxref{Enhancing text}), and the first non-comment line becomes the
title of the exported document.  If you need to include literal HTML,
use the special constructs described in @ref{Quoting HTML tags}.  The
table of contents is normally inserted directly before the first
headline of the file.  If you would like to get it to a different
location, insert the string @code{[TABLE-OF-CONTENTS]} on a line by
itself at the desired location.

Finally, if you want to use the space before the first headline for
internal purposes, but @emph{still} want to place something before the
first headline when exporting the file, you can use the @code{#+TEXT}
construct:

@example
#+OPTIONS: skip:t
#+TEXT: This text will go before the *first* headline.
#+TEXT: We place the table of contents here:
#+TEXT: [TABLE-OF-CONTENTS]
#+TEXT: This goes between the table of contents and the first headline
@end example

@node Footnotes, Quoted examples, Initial text, Text interpretation
@subsection Footnotes
@cindex footnotes
@cindex @file{footnote.el}

Numbers in square brackets are treated as footnotes, so that you can use
the Emacs package @file{footnote.el} to create footnotes.  For example:

@example
The org-mode homepage[1] clearly needs help from
a good web designer.

[1] The link is: http://orgmode.org
@end example

@noindent
@kindex C-c !
Note that the @file{footnote} package uses @kbd{C-c !} to invoke its
commands.  This binding conflicts with the org-mode command for
inserting inactive time stamps.  You could use the variable
@code{footnote-prefix} to switch footnotes commands to another key.  Or,
if you are too used to this binding, you could use
@code{org-replace-disputed-keys} and @code{org-disputed-keys} to change
the settings in Org-mode.

are several ways to do this:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If a headline starts with the word @samp{QUOTE}, the text below the

will also be exported in this way.
@end itemize

@subsection Enhancing text for export
@cindex enhancing text
@cindex richer text

Some of the export backends of Org-mode allow for sophisticated text
formatting, this is true in particular for the HTML and La@TeX{}
backends.  Org-mode has a number of typing conventions that allow to
produce a richly formatted output.

@itemize @bullet

@cindex hand-formatted lists
@cindex lists, hand-formatted
@item
Plain lists @samp{-}, @samp{*} or @samp{+} as bullet, or with @samp{1.}
or @samp{2)} as enumerator will be recognized and transformed if the
backend supports lists.  See @xref{Plain lists}.

@cindex underlined text
@cindex bold text
@cindex italic text
@cindex verbatim text
@item
You can make words @b{*bold*}, @i{/italic/}, _underlined_, @code{=code=}
and @code{~verbatim~}, and, if you must, @samp{+strikethrough+}.  Text
in the code and verbatim string is not processed for org-mode specific
syntax, it is exported verbatim.

@cindex horizontal rules, in exported files
@item
A line consisting of only dashes, and at least 5 of them, will be
exported as a horizontal line (@samp{<hr/>} in HTML).

@cindex LaTeX fragments, export
@cindex TeX macros, export
@item
Many @TeX{} macros and entire La@TeX{} fragments are converted into HTML
entities or images (@pxref{Embedded LaTeX}).

@cindex tables, export
@item
Tables are transformed into native tables under the exporter, if the
export backend supports this. Data fields before the first horizontal
separator line will be formatted as table header fields.

@cindex fixed width
@item
If a headline starts with the word @samp{QUOTE}, the text below the
headline will be typeset as fixed-width, to allow quoting of computer
codes etc.  Lines starting with @samp{:} are also typeset in fixed-width
font. 
@table @kbd
@kindex C-c :
@item C-c :
Toggle fixed-width for entry (QUOTE) or region, see below.
@end table
Finally, text between
@example
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
quoted text
#+END_EXAMPLE
@end example
will also be exported in this way.

@cindex linebreak, forced
@item 
A double backslash @emph{at the end of a line} enforces a line break at
this position.

@cindex HTML entities, LaTeX entities
@item
Strings like @code{\alpha} will be exported as @code{&alpha;}, in the
HTML output.  These strings are exported as @code{$\alpha$} in the
La@TeX{} output.  Similarly, @code{\nbsp} will become @code{&nbsp;} in
HTML and in La@TeX{}.  This applies for a long list of entities, see
the variable @code{org-html-entities} for the complete list.
@c FIXME
@end itemize

If these conversions conflict with your habits of typing ASCII text,
they can all be turned off with corresponding variables.  See the
customization group @code{org-export-general}, and the following section
which explains how to set export options with special lines in a
buffer.


@node Export options,  , Enhancing text, Text interpretation
@subsection Export options
@cindex options, for export

@cindex completion, of option keywords
The exporter recognizes special lines in the buffer which provide
additional information.  These lines may be put anywhere in the file.
The whole set of lines can be inserted into the buffer with @kbd{C-c
C-e t}.  For individual lines, a good way to make sure the keyword is
correct is to type @samp{#+} and then use @kbd{M-@key{TAB}} completion
(@pxref{Completion}).

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c C-e t
@item C-c C-e t
Insert template with export options, see example below.
@end table

@example
#+TITLE:     the title to be shown (default is the buffer name)
#+AUTHOR:    the author (default taken from @code{user-full-name})
#+DATE:      A date, fixed, of a format string for @code{format-time-string}
#+EMAIL:     his/her email address (default from @code{user-mail-address})
#+LANGUAGE:  language for HTML, e.g. @samp{en} (@code{org-export-default-language})
#+TEXT:      Some descriptive text to be inserted at the beginning.
#+TEXT:      Several lines may be given.
#+OPTIONS:   H:2 num:t toc:t \n:nil @@:t ::t |:t ^:t f:t TeX:t ...
@end example

@noindent
The OPTIONS line is a compact form to specify export settings.  Here
you can:
@cindex headline levels
@cindex section-numbers
@cindex table of contents
@cindex linebreak preservation
@cindex quoted HTML tags
@cindex fixed-width sections

           @r{you write "^:@{@}", @code{a_@{b@}} will be interpreted, but}
           @r{the simple @code{a_b} will be left as it is.}

These options take effect in both the HTML and La@TeX{} export, except
for @code{TeX} and @code{LaTeX}, which are respectively @code{t} and
@code{nil} for the La@TeX{} export.

@cindex publishing

Org-mode includes@footnote{@file{org-publish.el} is not distributed with
Emacs 21, if you are still using Emacs 21, you need you need to download
this file separately.} a publishing management system that allows you to
configure automatic HTML conversion of @emph{projects} composed of
interlinked org files.  This system is called @emph{org-publish}.  You can
also configure org-publish to automatically upload your exported HTML
pages and related attachments, such as images and source code files, to
a web server. Org-publish turns org-mode into a web-site authoring tool.

You can also use Org-publish to convert files into La@TeX{}, or even
combine HTML and La@TeX{} conversion so that files are available in both
formats on the server@footnote{Since La@TeX{} files on a server are not
that helpful, you surely want to perform further conversion on them --
e.g. convert them to @code{PDF} format.}.

Org-publish has been contributed to Org-mode by David O'Toole.

@subsection The variable @code{org-publish-project-alist}
@cindex org-publish-project-alist
@cindex projects, for publishing

Org-publish is configured almost entirely through setting the value of
one variable, called @code{org-publish-project-alist}.
Each element of the list configures one project, and may be in one of
the two following forms:

@lisp
("project-name"  :property value :property value ...)

@r{or} 
 
("project-name"  :components ("project-name" "project-name" ...))

@end lisp

In both cases, projects are configured by specifying property values.
A project defines the set of files that will be published, as well as
the publishing configuration to use when publishing those files.  When
a project takes the second form listed above, the individual members
of the ``components'' property are taken to be components of the
project, which group together files requiring different publishing
options. When you publish such a ``meta-project'' all the components
will also publish.

@node Sources and destinations, Selecting files, Project alist, Configuration
@subsection Sources and destinations for files
@cindex directories, for publishing

Most properties are optional, but some should always be set. In
particular, org-publish needs to know where to look for source files,
and where to put published files.

@item @code{:publishing-directory}

run @code{make} for updating files to be published.
@end multitable
@noindent

@node Selecting files, Publishing action, Sources and destinations, Configuration
@subsection Selecting files
@cindex files, selecting for publishing

By default, all files with extension @file{.org} in the base directory
are considered part of the project.  This can be modified by setting the
properties 
@multitable @columnfractions 0.25 0.75
@item @code{:base-extension}
@tab Extension (without the dot!) of source files.  This actually is a
regular expression.

@item @code{:exclude}

@item @code{:include}
@tab List of files to be included regardless of @code{:base-extension}
and @code{:exclude}.
@end multitable

@node Publishing action, Publishing options, Selecting files, Configuration
@subsection Publishing Action
@cindex action, for publishing

Publishing means that a file is copied to the destination directory and
possibly transformed in the process.  The default transformation is to
export Org-mode files as HTML files, and this is done by the function
@code{org-publish-org-to-html} which calls the HTML exporter
(@pxref{HTML export}). But you also can publish your files in La@TeX{} by
using the function @code{org-publish-org-to-latex} instead. Other files
like images only need to be copied to the publishing destination. For
non-Org-mode files, you need to specify the publishing function.


@multitable @columnfractions 0.3 0.7
@item @code{:publishing-function}
@tab Function executing the publication of a file.  This may also be a
list of functions, which will all be called in turn.
@end multitable

The function must accept two arguments: a property list containing at
least a @code{:publishing-directory} property, and the name of the file
to be published.  It should take the specified file, make the necessary
transformation (if any) and place the result into the destination folder.
You can write your own publishing function, but @code{org-publish}
provides one for attachments (files that only need to be copied):
@code{org-publish-attachment}.

@end multitable

If you use several email addresses, separate them by a semi-column.

Most of the @code{org-export-with-*} variables have the same effect in
both HTML and La@TeX{} exporters, except for @code{:TeX-macros} and
@code{:LaTeX-fragments}, respectively @code{nil} and @code{t} in the
La@TeX{} export.

When a property is given a value in @code{org-publish-project-alist},
its setting overrides the value of the corresponding user variable (if
any) during publishing.  Options set within a file (@pxref{Export
options}), however, override everything.

@node Publishing links, Project page index, Publishing options, Configuration
@subsection Links between published files
@cindex links, publishing

To create a link from one Org-mode file to another, you would use
something like @samp{[[file:foo.org][The foo]]} or simply
@samp{file:foo.org.} (@pxref{Hyperlinks}).  Upon publishing this link
becomes a link to @file{foo.html}.  In this way, you can interlink the
pages of your "org web" project and the links will work as expected when
you publish them to HTML.

You may also link to related files, such as images. Provided you are
careful with relative pathnames, and provided you have also configured
@code{org-publish} to upload the related files, these links will work
too. @ref{Complex example} for an example of this usage.

Sometime an Org-mode file to be published may contain links that are
only valid in your production environment, but not in the publishing
location.  In this case, use the property 

@multitable @columnfractions 0.4 0.6
@item @code{:link-validation-function}
@tab Function to validate links
@end multitable

@noindent
to define a function for checking link validity.  This function must
accept two arguments, the file name and a directory relative to which
the file name is interpreted in the production environment.  If this
function returns @code{nil}, then the HTML generator will only insert a
description into the HTML file, but no link.  One option for this
function is @code{org-publish-validate-link} which checks if the given
file is part of any project in @code{org-publish-project-alist}.

@node Project page index,  , Publishing links, Configuration
@subsection Project page index

The following properties may be used to control publishing of an

@item @code{:auto-index}
@tab When non-nil, publish an index during org-publish-current-project or

@item @code{:index-filename}
@tab Filename for output of index. Defaults to @file{index.org} (which

@item @code{:index-title}
@tab Title of index page. Defaults to name of file.

@item @code{:index-function}

of links to all files in the project.

@subsection Example: complex publishing configuration

This more complicated example publishes an entire website, including
org files converted to HTML, image files, emacs lisp source code, and
stylesheets. The publishing-directory is remote and private files are
excluded.

To ensure that links are preserved, care should be taken to replicate
your directory structure on the web server, and to use relative file
paths. For example, if your org files are kept in @file{~/org} and your
publishable images in @file{~/images}, you'd link to an image with
@c
@example
file:../images/myimage.png
@end example
@c
On the web server, the relative path to the image should be the
same. You can accomplish this by setting up an "images" folder in the
right place on the webserver, and publishing images to it.

Once org-publish is properly configured, you can publish with the
following functions: 

@table @kbd
@item C-c C-e C
Prompt for a specific project and publish all files that belong to it.
@item C-c C-e P
Publish the project containing the current file.
@item C-c C-e F
Publish only the current file.
@item C-c C-e A
Publish all projects.
@end table

Org uses timestamps to track when a file has changed. The above
functions normally only publish changed files. You can override this and
force publishing of all files by giving a prefix argument.

@section Summary of in-buffer settings
@cindex in-buffer settings
@cindex special keywords

Org-mode uses special lines in the buffer to define settings on a
per-file basis.  These lines start with a @samp{#+} followed by a
keyword, a colon, and then individual words defining a setting.  Several
setting words can be in the same line, but you can also have multiple
lines for the keyword.  While these settings are described throughout
the manual, here is a summary.  After changing any of those lines in the
buffer, press @kbd{C-c C-c} with the cursor still in the line to
activate the changes immediately.  Otherwise they become effective only
when the file is visited again in a new Emacs session.

@table @kbd
@item #+ARCHIVE: %s_done::
This line sets the archive location for the agenda file.  It applies for
all subsequent lines until the next @samp{#+ARCHIVE} line, or the end
of the file.  The first such line also applies to any entries before it.
The corresponding variable is @code{org-archive-location}.
@item #+CATEGORY:
This line sets the category for the agenda file.  The category applies
for all subsequent lines until the next @samp{#+CATEGORY} line, or the
end of the file.  The first such line also applies to any entries before it.
@item #+COLUMNS: %25ITEM .....
Set the default format for columns view.  This format applies when
columns view is invoked in location where no COLUMNS property applies.
@item #+CONSTANTS: name1=value1 ...
Set file-local values for constants to be used in table formulas.  This
line set the local variable @code{org-table-formula-constants-local}.
The global version of this variable is
@code{org-table-formula-constants}.
@item #+DRAWERS: NAME1 .....
Set the file-local set of drawers.  The corresponding global variable is
@code{org-drawers}.
@item #+LINK:  linkword replace
These lines (several are allowed) specify link abbreviations.
@xref{Link abbreviations}.  The corresponding variable is
@code{org-link-abbrev-alist}.
@item #+PRIORITIES: highest lowest default
This line sets the limits and the default for the priorities.  All three
must be either letters A-Z or numbers 0-9.  The highest priority must
have a lower ASCII number that the lowest priority.
@item #+PROPERTY: Property_Name Value
This line sets a default inheritance value for entries in the current
buffer, most useful for specifying the allowed values of a property.
@item #+STARTUP:
This line sets options to be used at startup of Org-mode, when an
Org-mode file is being visited.  The first set of options deals with the
initial visibility of the outline tree.  The corresponding variable for
global default settings is @code{org-startup-folded}, with a default
value @code{t}, which means @code{overview}.
@cindex @code{overview}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{content}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{showall}, STARTUP keyword
@example
overview   @r{top-level headlines only}
content    @r{all headlines}
showall    @r{no folding at all, show everything}
@end example
Then there are options for aligning tables upon visiting a file.  This
is useful in files containing narrowed table columns.  The corresponding
variable is @code{org-startup-align-all-tables}, with a default value
@code{nil}. 
@cindex @code{align}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{noalign}, STARTUP keyword
@example
align      @r{align all tables}
noalign    @r{don't align tables on startup}
@end example
Logging TODO state changes and clock intervals (variables
@code{org-log-done} and @code{org-log-repeat}) can be configured using
these options.
@cindex @code{logdone}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{nologging}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{lognotedone}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{lognoteclock-out}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{lognotestate}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{logrepeat}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{nologrepeat}, STARTUP keyword
@example
logging          @r{record a timestamp when an item is marked DONE}
nologging        @r{don't record when items are marked DONE}
lognotedone      @r{record timestamp and a note when DONE}
lognotestate     @r{record timestamp and a note when TODO state changes}
logrepeat        @r{record a note when re-instating a repeating item}
nologrepeat      @r{do not record when re-instating repeating item}
lognoteclock-out @r{record timestamp and a note when clocking out}
@end example
Here are the options for hiding leading stars in outline headings.  The
corresponding variables are @code{org-hide-leading-stars} and
@code{org-odd-levels-only}, both with a default setting @code{nil}
(meaning @code{showstars} and @code{oddeven}).
@cindex @code{hidestars}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{showstars}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{odd}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{even}, STARTUP keyword
@example
hidestars  @r{make all but one of the stars starting a headline invisible.}
showstars  @r{show all stars starting a headline}
odd        @r{allow only odd outline levels (1,3,...)}
oddeven    @r{allow all outline levels}
@end example
To turn on custom format overlays over time stamps (variables
@code{org-put-time-stamp-overlays} and
@code{org-time-stamp-overlay-formats}), use
@cindex @code{customtime}, STARTUP keyword
@example
customtime @r{overlay custom time format}
@end example
The following options influence the table spreadsheet (variable
@code{constants-unit-system}).
@cindex @code{constcgs}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{constSI}, STARTUP keyword
@example
constcgs   @r{@file{constants.el} should use the c-g-s unit system}
constSI    @r{@file{constants.el} should use the SI unit system}
@end example
@item #+TAGS:  TAG1(c1) TAG2(c2)
These lines (several such lines are allowed) specify the legal tags in
this file, and (potentially) the corresponding @emph{fast tag selection}
keys.  The corresponding variable is @code{org-tag-alist}.
@item #+TBLFM:
This line contains the formulas for the table directly above the line.
@item #+TITLE:, #+AUTHOR:, #+EMAIL:, #+LANGUAGE:, #+TEXT:, #+OPTIONS, #+DATE:
These lines provide settings for exporting files.  For more details see
@ref{Export options}.
@item #+SEQ_TODO:   #+TYP_TODO:
These lines set the TODO keywords and their interpretation in the
current file.  The corresponding variables are @code{org-todo-keywords}
and @code{org-todo-interpretation}.

@cindex C-c C-c, overview

The key @kbd{C-c C-c} has many purposes in org-mode, which are all
mentioned scattered throughout this manual.  One specific function of
this key is to add @emph{tags} to a headline (@pxref{Tags}).  In many
other circumstances it means something like @emph{Hey Org-mode, look
here and update according to what you see here}.  Here is a summary of
what this means in different contexts.

@itemize @minus
@item
If there are highlights in the buffer from the creation of a sparse
tree, or from clock display, remove these highlights.
@item
If the cursor is in one of the special @code{#+KEYWORD} lines, this
triggers scanning the buffer for these lines and updating the
information. 
@item
If the cursor is inside a table, realign the table.  This command
works even if the automatic table editor has been turned off.
@item
If the cursor is on a @code{#+TBLFM} line, re-apply the formulas to
the entire table.
@item
If the cursor is inside a table created by the @file{table.el} package,
activate that table.
@item
If the current buffer is a remember buffer, close the note and file it.
With a prefix argument, file it, without further interaction, to the
default location.
@item
If the cursor is on a @code{<<<target>>>}, update radio targets and
corresponding links in this buffer.
@item
If the cursor is in a property line or at the start or end of a property
drawer, offer property commands.

@node Clean view, TTY keys, The very busy C-c C-c key, Miscellaneous
@section A cleaner outline view
@cindex hiding leading stars
@cindex clean outline view

Some people find it noisy and distracting that the Org-mode headlines
are starting with a potentially large number of stars.  For example
the tree from @ref{Headlines}:

@example
* Top level headline
** Second level
*** 3rd level
    some text
*** 3rd level
    more text
* Another top level headline
@end example

@noindent
Unfortunately this is deeply ingrained into the code of Org-mode and
cannot be easily changed.  You can, however, modify the display in such
a way that all leading stars become invisible and the outline more easy
to read.  To do this, customize the variable
@code{org-hide-leading-stars} like this:

@lisp
(setq org-hide-leading-stars t)
@end lisp

@noindent
or change this on a per-file basis with one of the lines (anywhere in
the buffer)

@example
#+STARTUP: showstars
#+STARTUP: hidestars
@end example

@noindent
Press @kbd{C-c C-c} with the cursor in a @samp{STARTUP} line to activate
the modifications.

With stars hidden, the tree becomes:

@example
* Top level headline
 * Second level
  * 3rd level
    some text
  * 3rd level
    more text
* Another top level headline
@end example

@noindent
Note that the leading stars are not truly replaced by whitespace, they
are only fontified with the face @code{org-hide} that uses the
background color as font color.  If you are not using either white or
black background, you may have to customize this face to get the wanted
effect.  Another possibility is to set this font such that the extra
stars are @i{almost} invisible, for example using the color
@code{grey90} on a white background.

Things become cleaner still if you skip all the even levels and use only
odd levels 1, 3, 5..., effectively adding two stars to go from one
outline level to the next:

@example
* Top level headline
  * Second level
    * 3rd level
      some text
    * 3rd level
      more text
* Another top level headline
@end example

@noindent
In order to make the structure editing and export commands handle this
convention correctly, use

@lisp
(setq org-odd-levels-only t)
@end lisp

@noindent
or set this on a per-file basis with one of the following lines (don't
forget to press @kbd{C-c C-c} with the cursor in the startup line to
activate changes immediately).

@example
#+STARTUP: odd
#+STARTUP: oddeven
@end example

You can convert an Org-mode file from single-star-per-level to the
double-star-per-level convention with @kbd{M-x org-convert-to-odd-levels
RET} in that file.  The reverse operation is @kbd{M-x
org-convert-to-oddeven-levels}.

@section Using org-mode on a tty
@cindex tty keybindings

Because Org-mode contains a large number of commands, by default much of
Org-mode's core commands are bound to keys that are generally not
accessible on a tty, such as the cursor keys (@key{left}, @key{right},
@key{up}, @key{down}), @key{TAB} and @key{RET}, in particular when used
together with modifiers like @key{Meta} and/or @key{Shift}.  To access
these commands on a tty when special keys are unavailable, the following
alternative bindings can be used.  The tty bindings below will likely be
more cumbersome; you may find for some of the bindings below that a
customized work-around suits you better.  For example, changing a time
stamp is really only fun with @kbd{S-@key{cursor}} keys, whereas on a
tty you would rather use @kbd{C-c .} to re-insert the timestamp.

@cindex @file{calc.el}
@item @file{calc.el} by Dave Gillespie
Org-mode uses the calc package for implementing spreadsheet
functionality in its tables (@pxref{The spreadsheet}).  Org-mode
checks for the availability of calc by looking for the function
@code{calc-eval} which should be autoloaded in your setup if calc has
been installed properly.  As of Emacs 22, calc is part of the Emacs
distribution.  Another possibility for interaction between the two
packages is using calc for embedded calculations. @xref{Embedded Mode,
, Embedded Mode, calc, GNU Emacs Calc Manual}.
@cindex @file{constants.el}
@item @file{constants.el} by Carsten Dominik
In a table formula (@pxref{The spreadsheet}), it is possible to use
names for natural constants or units.  Instead of defining your own
constants in the variable @code{org-table-formula-constants}, install
the @file{constants} package which defines a large number of constants
and units, and lets you use unit prefixes like @samp{M} for
@samp{Mega} etc.  You will need version 2.0 of this package, available
at @url{http://www.astro.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools}. Org-mode checks for
the function @code{constants-get}, which has to be autoloaded in your
setup.  See the installation instructions in the file
@file{constants.el}.
@item @file{cdlatex.el} by Carsten Dominik
@cindex @file{cdlatex.el}
Org-mode can make use of the cdlatex package to efficiently enter
La@TeX{} fragments into Org-mode files. See @ref{CDLaTeX mode}.
@item @file{imenu.el} by Ake Stenhoff and Lars Lindberg
@cindex @file{imenu.el}
Imenu allows menu access to an index of items in a file.  Org-mode
supports imenu - all you need to do to get the index is the following:
@lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 
          (lambda () 'imenu-add-to-menubar "Imenu"))
@end lisp
By default the index is two levels deep - you can modify the depth using
the option @code{org-imenu-depth}.
@item @file{remember.el} by John Wiegley

Org mode cooperates with remember, see @ref{Remember}.
@file{Remember.el} is not part of Emacs, find it on the web.
@item @file{speedbar.el} by Eric M. Ludlam
@cindex @file{speedbar.el}
Speedbar is a package that creates a special frame displaying files and
index items in files.  Org-mode supports speedbar and allows you to
drill into Org-mode files directly from the speedbar.  It also allows to
restrict the scope of agenda commands to a file or a subtree by using
the command @kbd{<} in the speedbar frame.

Complex ASCII tables with automatic line wrapping, column- and
row-spanning, and alignment can be created using the Emacs table
package by Takaaki Ota (@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/table},
and also part of Emacs 22).
When @key{TAB} or @kbd{C-c C-c} is pressed in such a table, Org-mode
will call @command{table-recognize-table} and move the cursor into the
table.  Inside a table, the keymap of Org-mode is inactive.  In order
to execute Org-mode-related commands, leave the table.

@table @kbd

Startup of Org-mode may fail with the error message
@code{(wrong-type-argument keymapp nil)} when there is an outdated
version @file{allout.el} on the load path, for example the version
distributed with Emacs 21.x.  Upgrade to Emacs 22 and this problem will
disappear.  If for some reason you cannot do this, make sure that org.el
is loaded @emph{before} @file{allout.el}, for example by putting
@code{(require 'org)} early enough into your @file{.emacs} file.

@item @file{CUA.el} by Kim. F. Storm
Keybindings in Org-mode conflict with the @kbd{S-<cursor>} keys used by
CUA-mode (as well as pc-select-mode and s-region-mode) to select and
extend the region.  If you want to use one of these packages along with
Org-mode, configure the variable @code{org-replace-disputed-keys}.  When
set, Org-mode will move the following keybindings in Org-mode files, and
in the agenda buffer (but not during date selection).

@example
S-UP    -> M-p             S-DOWN  -> M-n
S-LEFT  -> M--             S-RIGHT -> M-+

Org-mode supports the syntax of the footnote package, but only the

commands, @kbd{C-c !} is already used by Org-mode.  You could use the
variable @code{footnote-prefix} to switch footnotes commands to another
key.  Or, you could use @code{org-replace-disputed-keys} and
@code{org-disputed-keys} to change the settings in Org-mode.

@section Bugs
@cindex bugs

Here is a list of things that should work differently, but which I
have found too hard to fix.

@itemize @bullet
@item
If a table field starts with a link, and if the corresponding table
column is narrowed (@pxref{Narrow columns}) to a width too small to
display the link, the field would look entirely empty even though it is
not.  To prevent this, Org-mode throws an error.  The work-around is to
make the column wide enough to fit the link, or to add some text (at
least 2 characters) before the link in the same field.
@item
Narrowing table columns does not work on XEmacs, because the
@code{format} function does not transport text properties.
@item
Text in an entry protected with the @samp{QUOTE} keyword should not
autowrap.
@item
When the application called by @kbd{C-c C-o} to open a file link fails
(for example because the application does not exist or refuses to open
the file), it does so silently.  No error message is displayed.
@item
Recalculating a table line applies the formulas from left to right.
If a formula uses @emph{calculated} fields further down the row,
multiple recalculation may be needed to get all fields consistent.  You
may use the command @code{org-table-iterate} (@kbd{C-u C-c *}) to
recalculate until convergence.
@item
A single letter cannot be made bold, for example @samp{*a*}.
@item
The exporters work well, but could be made more efficient.

@section Adding hyperlink types
@cindex hyperlinks, adding new types

Org-mode has a large number of hyperlink types built-in
(@pxref{Hyperlinks}).  If you would like to add new link types, it
provides an interface for doing so.  Lets look at an example file
@file{org-man.el} that will add support for creating links like
@samp{[[man:printf][The printf manpage]]} to show unix manual pages inside
emacs:

@lisp
;;; org-man.el - Support for links to manpages in Org-mode

(require 'org)

(org-add-link-type "man" 'org-man-open)
(add-hook 'org-store-link-functions 'org-man-store-link)

(defcustom org-man-command 'man
  "The Emacs command to be used to display a man page."
  :group 'org-link
  :type '(choice (const man) (const woman)))

(defun org-man-open (path)
  "Visit the manpage on PATH.
PATH should be a topic that can be thrown at the man command."
  (funcall org-man-command path))

(defun org-man-store-link ()
  "Store a link to a manpage."
  (when (memq major-mode '(Man-mode woman-mode))
    ;; This is a man page, we do make this link
    (let* ((page (org-man-get-page-name))
           (link (concat "man:" page))
           (description (format "Manpage for %s" page)))
      (org-store-link-props
       :type "man"
       :link link
       :description description))))

(defun org-man-get-page-name ()
  "Extract the page name from the buffer name."
  ;; This works for both `Man-mode' and `woman-mode'.
  (if (string-match " \\(\\S-+\\)\\*" (buffer-name))
      (match-string 1 (buffer-name))
    (error "Cannot create link to this man page")))

(provide 'org-man)

;;; org-man.el ends here
@end lisp

@noindent
You would activate this new link type in @file{.emacs} with

@lisp
(require 'org-man)
@end lisp

@noindent
Lets go through the file and see what it does.
@enumerate
@item 
It does @code{(require 'org)} to make sure that @file{org.el} has been
loaded.
@item
The next line calls @code{org-add-link-type} to define a new link type
with prefix @samp{man}.  The call also contains the name of a function
that will be called to follow such a link.
@item
The next line adds a function to @code{org-store-link-functions}, in
order to allow the command @kbd{C-c l} to record a useful link in a
buffer displaying a man page.
@end enumerate

The rest of the file defines the necessary variables and functions.
First there is a customization variable that determines which emacs
command should be used to display manpages.  There are two options,
@code{man} and @code{woman}.  Then the function to follow a link is
defined.  It gets the link path as an argument - in this case the link
path is just a topic for the manual command.  The function calls the
value of @code{org-man-command} to display the man page.

Finally the function @code{org-man-store-link} is defined.  When you try
to store a link with @kbd{C-c l}, also this function will be called to
try to make a link.  The function must first decide if it is supposed to
create the link for this buffer type, we do this by checking the value
of the variable @code{major-mode}.  If not, the function must exit and
retunr the value @code{nil}.  If yes, the link is created by getting the
manual tpoic from the buffer name and prefixing it with the string
@samp{man:}.  Then it must call the command @code{org-store-link-props}
and set the @code{:type} and @code{:link} properties.  Optionally you
can also set the @code{:description} property to provide a default for
the link description when the link is later inserted into tan Org-mode
buffer with @kbd{C-c C-l}.

@node Tables in arbitrary syntax, Dynamic blocks, Adding hyperlink types, Extensions and Hacking
@section Tables and Lists in arbitrary syntax
@cindex tables, in other modes
@cindex lists, in other modes
@cindex orgtbl-mode

Since Orgtbl-mode can be used as a minor mode in arbitrary buffers, a
frequent feature request has been to make it work with native tables in
specific languages, for example La@TeX{}.  However, this is extremely
hard to do in a general way, would lead to a customization nightmare,
and would take away much of the simplicity of the Orgtbl-mode table
editor.


This appendix describes a different approach.  We keep the Orgtbl-mode
table in its native format (the @i{source table}), and use a custom
function to @i{translate} the table to the correct syntax, and to
@i{install} it in the right location (the @i{target table}).  This puts
the burden of writing conversion functions on the user, but it allows
for a very flexible system.

Bastien added the ability to do the same with lists.  You can use Org's
facilities to edit and structure lists by turning @code{orgstruct-mode}
on, then locally exporting such lists in another format (HTML, La@TeX{}
or TeXInfo.)

@end menu

@subsection Radio tables
@cindex radio tables

To define the location of the target table, you first need to create two
lines that are comments in the current mode, but contain magic words for
Orgtbl-mode to find.  Orgtbl-mode will insert the translated table
between these lines, replacing whatever was there before.  For example:

@example
/* BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */
/* END RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */
@end example

@noindent
Just above the source table, we put a special line that tells
Orgtbl-mode how to translate this table and where to install it.  For
example:
@example
#+ORGTBL: SEND table_name translation_function arguments....
@end example

@noindent
@code{table_name} is the reference name for the table that is also used
in the receiver lines. @code{translation_function} is the Lisp function
that does the translation.  Furthermore, the line can contain a list of
arguments (alternating key and value) at the end.  The arguments will be
passed as a property list to the translation function for
interpretation.  A few standard parameters are already recognized and
acted upon before the translation function is called:

@table @code
@item :skip N
Skip the first N lines of the table. Hlines do count!
@item :skipcols (n1 n2 ...)
List of columns that should be skipped.  If the table has a column with
calculation marks, that column is automatically discarded as well.
Please note that the translator function sees the table @emph{after} the
removal of these columns, the function never knows that there have been
additional columns.
@end table

@noindent
The one problem remaining is how to keep the source table in the buffer
without disturbing the normal workings of the file, for example during
compilation of a C file or processing of a La@TeX{} file.  There are a
number of different solutions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The table could be placed in a block comment if that is supported by the
language.  For example, in C-mode you could wrap the table between
@samp{/*} and @samp{*/} lines.
@item 
Sometimes it is possible to put the table after some kind of @i{END}
statement, for example @samp{\bye} in TeX and @samp{\end@{document@}}
in La@TeX{}.
@item
You can just comment the table line by line whenever you want to process
the file, and uncomment it whenever you need to edit the table.  This
only sounds tedious - the command @kbd{M-x orgtbl-toggle-comment} does
make this comment-toggling very easy, in particular if you bind it to a
key.
@end itemize

@node A LaTeX example, Translator functions, Radio tables, Tables in arbitrary syntax
@subsection A LaTeX example of radio tables
@cindex LaTeX, and orgtbl-mode

The best way to wrap the source table in La@TeX{} is to use the
@code{comment} environment provided by @file{comment.sty}.  It has to be
activated by placing @code{\usepackage@{comment@}} into the document
header.  Orgtbl-mode can insert a radio table skeleton@footnote{By
default this works only for La@TeX{}, HTML, and TeXInfo.  Configure the
variable @code{orgtbl-radio-tables} to install templates for other
modes.}  with the command @kbd{M-x orgtbl-insert-radio-table}.  You will
be prompted for a table name, lets say we use @samp{salesfigures}.  You
will then get the following template:

@example
% BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
% END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
\begin@{comment@}
#+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex
| | |
\end@{comment@}
@end example

@noindent
The @code{#+ORGTBL: SEND} line tells orgtbl-mode to use the function
@code{orgtbl-to-latex} to convert the table into La@TeX{} and to put it
into the receiver location with name @code{salesfigures}.  You may now
fill in the table, feel free to use the spreadsheet features@footnote{If
the @samp{#+TBLFM} line contains an odd number of dollar characters,
this may cause problems with font-lock in latex-mode.  As shown in the
example you can fix this by adding an extra line inside the
@code{comment} environment that is used to balance the dollar
expressions.  If you are using AUCTeX with the font-latex library, a
much better solution is to add the @code{comment} environment to the
variable @code{LaTeX-verbatim-environments}.}:

@example
% BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
% END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
\begin@{comment@}
#+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex
| Month | Days | Nr sold | per day |
|-------+------+---------+---------|
| Jan   |   23 |      55 |     2.4 |
| Feb   |   21 |      16 |     0.8 |
| March |   22 |     278 |    12.6 |
#+TBLFM: $4=$3/$2;%.1f
% $ (optional extra dollar to keep font-lock happy, see footnote)
\end@{comment@}
@end example

@noindent
When you are done, press @kbd{C-c C-c} in the table to get the converted
table inserted between the two marker lines.

Now lets assume you want to make the table header by hand, because you
want to control how columns are aligned etc.  In this case we make sure
that the table translator does skip the first 2 lines of the source
table, and tell the command to work as a @i{splice}, i.e. to not produce
header and footer commands of the target table:

@example
\begin@{tabular@}@{lrrr@}
Month & \multicolumn@{1@}@{c@}@{Days@} & Nr.\ sold & per day\\
% BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
% END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
\end@{tabular@}
%
\begin@{comment@}
#+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex :splice t :skip 2
| Month | Days | Nr sold | per day |
|-------+------+---------+---------|
| Jan   |   23 |      55 |     2.4 |
| Feb   |   21 |      16 |     0.8 |
| March |   22 |     278 |    12.6 |
#+TBLFM: $4=$3/$2;%.1f
\end@{comment@}
@end example

The La@TeX{} translator function @code{orgtbl-to-latex} is already part of
Orgtbl-mode.  It uses a @code{tabular} environment to typeset the table
and marks horizontal lines with @code{\hline}.  Furthermore, it
interprets the following parameters:

@table @code
@item :splice nil/t
When set to t, return only table body lines, don't wrap them into a
tabular environment.  Default is nil.

@item :fmt fmt
A format to be used to wrap each field, should contain @code{%s} for the
original field value.  For example, to wrap each field value in dollars,
you could use @code{:fmt "$%s$"}.  This may also be a property list with
column numbers and formats. for example @code{:fmt (2 "$%s$" 4 "%s\\%%")}.

@item :efmt efmt
Use this format to print numbers with exponentials.  The format should
have @code{%s} twice for inserting mantissa and exponent, for example
@code{"%s\\times10^@{%s@}"}.  The default is @code{"%s\\,(%s)"}.  This
may also be a property list with column numbers and formats, for example
@code{:efmt (2 "$%s\\times10^@{%s@}$" 4 "$%s\\cdot10^@{%s@}$")}.  After
@code{efmt} has been applied to a value, @code{fmt} will also be
applied.
@end table

@node Translator functions, Radio lists, A LaTeX example, Tables in arbitrary syntax
@subsection Translator functions
@cindex HTML, and orgtbl-mode
@cindex translator function

Orgtbl-mode has several translator functions built-in:
@code{orgtbl-to-latex}, @code{orgtbl-to-html}, and
@code{orgtbl-to-texinfo}.  Except for @code{orgtbl-to-html}@footnote{The
HTML translator uses the same code that produces tables during HTML
export.}, these all use a generic translator, @code{orgtbl-to-generic}.
For example, @code{orgtbl-to-latex} itself is a very short function that
computes the column definitions for the @code{tabular} environment,
defines a few field and line separators and then hands over to the
generic translator.  Here is the entire code:

@lisp
@group
(defun orgtbl-to-latex (table params)
  "Convert the orgtbl-mode TABLE to LaTeX."
  (let* ((alignment (mapconcat (lambda (x) (if x "r" "l"))
                               org-table-last-alignment ""))
         (params2
          (list
           :tstart (concat "\\begin@{tabular@}@{" alignment "@}")
           :tend "\\end@{tabular@}"
           :lstart "" :lend " \\\\" :sep " & "
           :efmt "%s\\,(%s)" :hline "\\hline")))
    (orgtbl-to-generic table (org-combine-plists params2 params))))
@end group
@end lisp

As you can see, the properties passed into the function (variable
@var{PARAMS}) are combined with the ones newly defined in the function
(variable @var{PARAMS2}).  The ones passed into the function (i.e. the
ones set by the @samp{ORGTBL SEND} line) take precedence.  So if you
would like to use the La@TeX{} translator, but wanted the line endings to
be @samp{\\[2mm]} instead of the default @samp{\\}, you could just
overrule the default with

@example
#+ORGTBL: SEND test orgtbl-to-latex :lend " \\\\[2mm]"
@end example

For a new language, you can either write your own converter function in
analogy with the La@TeX{} translator, or you can use the generic function
directly.  For example, if you have a language where a table is started
with @samp{!BTBL!}, ended with @samp{!ETBL!}, and where table lines are
started with @samp{!BL!}, ended with @samp{!EL!} and where the field
separator is a TAB, you could call the generic translator like this (on
a single line!):

@example
#+ORGTBL: SEND test orgtbl-to-generic :tstart "!BTBL!" :tend "!ETBL!"
                              :lstart "!BL! " :lend " !EL!" :sep "\t"
@end example

@noindent
Please check the documentation string of the function
@code{orgtbl-to-generic} for a full list of parameters understood by
that function and remember that you can pass each of them into
@code{orgtbl-to-latex}, @code{orgtbl-to-texinfo}, and any other function
using the generic function.

Of course you can also write a completely new function doing complicated
things the generic translator cannot do.  A translator function takes
two arguments.  The first argument is the table, a list of lines, each
line either the symbol @code{hline} or a list of fields.  The second
argument is the property list containing all parameters specified in the
@samp{#+ORGTBL: SEND} line.  The function must return a single string
containing the formatted table.  If you write a generally useful
translator, please post it on @code{emacs-orgmode@@gnu.org} so that
others can benefit from your work.

@node  Radio lists,  , Translator functions, Tables in arbitrary syntax
@subsection Radio lists
@cindex radio lists
@cindex org-list-insert-radio-list

Sending and receiving radio lists works exactly the same way than
sending and receiving radio tables (@pxref{Radio tables}) @footnote{You
need to load the @code{org-export-latex.el} package to use radio lists
since the relevant code is there for now.}.  As for radio tables, you
can insert radio lists templates in HTML, La@TeX{} and TeXInfo modes by
calling @code{org-list-insert-radio-list}.

Here are the differences with radio tables:

@itemize @minus
@item
Use @code{ORGLST} instead of @code{ORGTBL}.
@item
The available translation functions for radio lists don't take
parameters.
@item 
`C-c C-c' will work when pressed on the first item of the list.
@end itemize

Here is a La@TeX{} example.  Let's say that you have this in your
La@TeX{} file:

@example
% BEGIN RECEIVE ORGLST to-buy
% END RECEIVE ORGLST to-buy
\begin@{comment@}
#+ORGLIST: SEND to-buy orgtbl-to-latex
- a new house
- a new computer
  + a new keyboard
  + a new mouse
- a new life
\end@{comment@}
@end example

Pressing `C-c C-c' on @code{a new house} and will insert the converted
La@TeX{} list between the two marker lines.

@node Dynamic blocks, Special agenda views, Tables in arbitrary syntax, Extensions and Hacking
@section Dynamic blocks
@cindex dynamic blocks

Org-mode documents can contain @emph{dynamic blocks}.  These are
specially marked regions that are updated by some user-written function.
A good example for such a block is the clock table inserted by the
command @kbd{C-c C-x C-r} (@pxref{Clocking work time}).

Dynamic block are enclosed by a BEGIN-END structure that assigns a name
to the block and can also specify parameters for the function producing
the content of the block.

@example
#+BEGIN: myblock :parameter1 value1 :parameter2 value2 ...

#+END:
@end example

Dynamic blocks are updated with the following commands

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c C-x C-u
@item C-c C-x C-u
Update dynamic block at point.
@kindex C-u C-c C-x C-u
@item C-u C-c C-x C-u
Update all dynamic blocks in the current file.
@end table

Updating a dynamic block means to remove all the text between BEGIN and
END, parse the BEGIN line for parameters and then call the specific
writer function for this block to insert the new content.  For a block
with name @code{myblock}, the writer function is
@code{org-dblock-write:myblock} with as only parameter a property list
with the parameters given in the begin line.  Here is a trivial example
of a block that keeps track of when the block update function was last
run:

@example
#+BEGIN: block-update-time :format "on %m/%d/%Y at %H:%M"

#+END:
@end example

@noindent
The corresponding block writer function could look like this:

@lisp
(defun org-dblock-write:block-update-time (params)
   (let ((fmt (or (plist-get params :format) "%d. %m. %Y")))
     (insert "Last block update at: "
             (format-time-string fmt (current-time)))))
@end lisp

If you want to make sure that all dynamic blocks are always up-to-date,
you could add the function @code{org-update-all-dblocks} to a hook, for
example @code{before-save-hook}.  @code{org-update-all-dblocks} is
written in a way that is does nothing in buffers that are not in Org-mode.

@node Special agenda views, Using the property API, Dynamic blocks, Extensions and Hacking
@section Special Agenda Views
@cindex agenda views, user-defined

Org-mode provides a special hook that can be used to narrow down the
selection made by any of the agenda views.  You may specify a function
that is used at each match to verify if the match should indeed be part
of the agenda view, and if not, how much should be skipped.

Let's say you want to produce a list of projects that contain a WAITING
tag anywhere in the project tree.  Let's further assume that you have
marked all tree headings that define a project with the todo keyword
PROJECT.  In this case you would run a todo search for the keyword
PROJECT, but skip the match unless there is a WAITING tag anywhere in
the subtree belonging to the project line.

To achieve this, you must write a function that searches the subtree for
the tag.  If the tag is found, the function must return @code{nil} to
indicate that this match should not be skipped.  If there is no such
tag, return the location of the end of the subtree, to indicate that
search should continue from there.

@lisp
(defun my-skip-unless-waiting ()
  "Skip trees that are not waiting"
  (let ((subtree-end (save-excursion (org-end-of-subtree t))))
    (if (re-search-forward ":WAITING:" subtree-end t)
        nil          ; tag found, do not skip
      subtree-end))) ; tag not found, continue after end of subtree
@end lisp

Now you may use this function in an agenda custom command, for example
like this:

@lisp
(org-add-agenda-custom-command
 '("b" todo "PROJECT"
   ((org-agenda-skip-function 'my-org-waiting-projects)
    (org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects waiting for something: "))))
@end lisp

Note that this also binds @code{org-agenda-overriding-header} to get a
meaningful header in the agenda view.

You may also put a Lisp form into @code{org-agenda-skip-function}.  In
particular, you may use the functions @code{org-agenda-skip-entry-if}
and @code{org-agenda-skip-subtree-if} in this form, for example:

@table @code
@item '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled)
Skip current entry if it has been scheduled.
@item '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'notscheduled)
Skip current entry if it has not been scheduled.
@item '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'deadline)
Skip current entry if it has a deadline.
@item '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled 'deadline)
Skip current entry if it has a deadline, or if it is scheduled.
@item '(org-agenda-skip-entry 'regexp "regular expression")
Skip current entry if the regular expression matches in the entry.
@item '(org-agenda-skip-entry 'notregexp "regular expression")
Skip current entry unless the regular expression matches.
@item '(org-agenda-skip-subtree-if 'regexp "regular expression")
Same as above, but check and skip the entire subtree.
@end table

Therefore we could also have written the search for WAITING projects
like this, even without defining a special function:

@lisp
(org-add-agenda-custom-command
 '("b" todo "PROJECT"
   ((org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-subtree-if
                                'regexp ":WAITING:"))
    (org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects waiting for something: "))))
@end lisp

Org-mode was borne in 2003, out of frustration over the user interface
of the Emacs outline-mode.  I was trying to organize my notes and
projects, and using Emacs seemed to be the natural way to go.  However,
having to remember eleven different commands with two or three keys per
command, only to hide and unhide parts of the outline tree, that seemed
entirely unacceptable to me.  Also, when using outlines to take notes, I
constantly want to restructure the tree, organizing it parallel to my
thoughts and plans.  @emph{Visibility cycling} and @emph{structure
editing} were originally implemented in the package
@file{outline-magic.el}, but quickly moved to the more general
@file{org.el}.  As this environment became comfortable for project
planning, the next step was adding @emph{TODO entries}, basic @emph{time
stamps}, and @emph{table support}.  These areas highlight the two main
goals that Org-mode still has today: To create a new, outline-based,
plain text mode with innovative and intuitive editing features, and to
incorporate project planning functionality directly into a notes file.

Since the first release, literally thousands of emails to me or on
@code{emacs-orgmode@@gnu.org} have provided a constant stream of bug
reports, feedback, new ideas, and sometimes patches and add-on code.
Many thanks to everyone who has helped to improve this package.  I am
trying to keep here a list of the people who had significant influence
in shaping one or more aspects of Org-mode.  The list may not be
complete, if I have forgotten someone, please accept my apologies and
