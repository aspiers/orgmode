- Simplicity :: Org-mode is a simple outliner for note-taking and list
     management. You can learn the basics for using it in [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/orgtutorial_dto.php][five
     minutes]].  This may be all you need, and Org-mode will not impose
     more complex features on you.
- Portability :: Org files are plain text.  You can view and edit them
     in any editor.  Your data is yours forever.  Org-mode runs in
     [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]], which is available for nearly every platform.
- Depth :: Org-mode will not let you down when you need more than a
     simple outline.  The full feature set is both [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Main-Index.html#Main-Index][broad]] and [[http://orgmode.org/manual/index.html][deep]].
     The typical [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.php][answer]] to "/Can it do X?/" is "/Yes!/".
- Flexibility :: Org-mode is like a Swiss army knife.  People use it
     for [[http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/orgmode.html][Getting Things Done (GTD)]], as a [[http://www.newartisans.com/blog_files/org.mode.day.planner.php][Day Planner]], as a [[http://sachachua.com/wp/2008/01/18/outlining-your-notes-with-org/][Notebook]],
     for Web and PDF [[http://orgmode.org][Authoring]], and much more.
- Support :: Org-mode is supported by an active [[id:0B280B26-A3AB-4E5C-B4EE-B7FFC52C4D26][mailing list]] where
     questions are answered quickly and effectively.
- It's free! :: Org is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software][open source software]], it is [[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL][free]], like Emacs.

** Worg

[[http://orgmode.org/worg/][Worg]], created by [[http://www.cognition.ens.fr/~guerry/][Bastien Guerry]], is a setup to allow users to jointly
edit a number of Org-mode files containing documentation about
Org-mode, including the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.php][Org Mode FAQ]] and [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/index.php][Tutorials]].  Worg is similar
to a wiki in that allows community to edit the contents.  However,
since it uses a distributed version control system, you do not have to
be online while editing it.  If you'd like to contribute to Worg,
please go to [[http://orgmode.org/worg/][the Worg page]], and start from there.

** Contributing to Org-mode

You can always contribute with ideas and bug reports on the mailing
list.  If you want to contribute a patch, code snippets, or a full
add-on, this is very welcome too!  We do distribute good add-ons as
contributed packages under more-or-less arbitrary licenses.  However,
to integrate additions into the Org-mode core, the author needs to
assign the copyright to the [[http://www.fsf.org/][Free Software Foundation]].  This is because
the Org-mode core is part of Emacs.  Emacs is distributed under the
[[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html][GNU Public License version 3]], and all packages included with it must
do the same.  If you would like to sign the papers, use [[file:request-assign-future.txt][this form]],
fill it in and [[mailto:assign@gnu.org,carsten.dominik@gmail.com][send]] it to the FSF with a copy to the Org-mode
maintainer.
